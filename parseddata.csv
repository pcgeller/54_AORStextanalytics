COBRA is a cost comparison model that allows an analyst to compare competing BRAC scenarios and up until now has not been used outside of BRAC. However, the Military Departments could use COBRA to provide cost comparisons for day-to-day stationing or strategic stationing decisions. COBRA has not been updated since the 2005 BRAC round, when a DoD Joint Process Action Team (JPAT) rewrote multiple algorithms to account for changes in technology and DoD business operations. To fully understand the magnitude of strategic stationing decisions, the DoD needs to consider the costs and savings associated with alternative stationing scenarios in a consistent manner. An enhanced COBRA model with additional analytic capabilities will support such a need. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has initiated a new JPAT outside of BRAC to review the COBRA model’s structure, analysis capabilities, and algorithms. The JPAT will update algorithms due to technology and business practices as in the past, but is also looking to improve the user experience and enhance its analytic capabilities to provide a more powerful decision support system for the Departments. Once the model is updated, the Departments can use COBRA in all stationing analyses to inform decisions outside of BRAC as well as prepare to support any future BRAC. We will discuss the JPAT initiative and the planned analytic enhancements.","001_Harrop_CAARA_Cost_of_Base_Realignment_Actions_(COBRA)_Model_Enhancement_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

This increased demand for analytical products places pressure on analysts to more quickly model and analyze increasingly complex problems. The baseline analytical tools (e.g. Excel) provided, however, often make visualizing the problem, retracing the analyst’s process, and/or replicating the work exceedingly difficult. Programming provides analysts one solution, but not every analyst is a programmer. Fortunately, other tools, such as SPSS Modeler and Tableau, support modeling and visualization of the problem set through to visualization of the results for the decision maker without the need to learn a programming language. Deployment of these tools to support the quick modeling and visualization of complex problems will be highlighted as well as best practices for effective visualizations for decision makers.","002_Rochelle_CAA__Effective_Visualization_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

In order to deliver an assessment that will provide the commander salient insights, individuals leading assessments must trigger a paradigm shift. Rather than primarily focusing on the collection of data and the measurement of progress against effects and objectives, they must first comprehensively identify, examine, and mitigate the impact of systemic challenges present in the operational environment. A solid assessment framework will provide insights, but an operational assessment’s effectiveness lies in its ability to inform the commander and enable him/her to direct actions that advance the campaign. Failure to identify and mitigate the impact of systemic challenges on the assessment, and other staff work, ensures the assessment will not inform the Commander’s decisions about the campaign or improve the effectiveness of operations. Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) serves as an excellent case study of how systemic challenges require a shift in the assessments paradigm. Systemic challenges present at CJTF-HOA, while not exhaustive, include a Joint Manning Document that does not support requirements for the current mission, limited legal and fiscal authorities, high personnel turnover (approximately 150% annually), and limited boots on the ground throughout the area of operations (limited sensors). These systemic challenges, and various other factors, consistently impact the value of the insights the assessment provides the commander and the staff. Recently implemented best practices designed to mitigate the impact of systemic challenges highlighted above will be discussed.","003_Rochelle_CAA_Shifting_the_Assessments_Paradigm_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

In response to this ongoing requirement, CAA developed a repeatable and adaptable methodology using prior modeled output modified to address alternative assumptions of target density and munitions availability. As a process improvement, a repeatable and adaptable tool using this methodology is being developed which provides the decision maker flexibility in assumptions and inputs while calculating a reasonable shot distribution and projected kills. The tool has two inputs: the quantity of munitions by type and the quantity of targets by type which can be varied by the decision maker. To calculate the shot distribution of munitions to targets, two preferred realities are considered: 1) Given a quantity of munitions what is the preferred shot to target, and 2) Given a quantity of targets what is the preferred munitions required to address them. These ratios and the expected red system kills are currently being calculated using modeled output from a representative scenario, but this tool is designed to be modified based on SME input. By comparing what you would prefer to shoot your munitions at, with how you would prefer to kill a target, it’s possible to create a munitions-to-target shot distribution constrained by munitions availability and target density.","004_Smith_CAADE_Munitions_Effectiveness_Tool_to_Address_Multivaraiant_Realities_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

One of the elements of the Quantitative War Reserve Requirements for Munition (QWARRM) study is considering future force structure changes and the combat support and service support requirements when estimating combat loads. By leveraging existing studies and modeled output, it was possible to recycle existing data to determine a reasonable deployment profile by standard requirements code (SRC) across multiple years. By cross multiplying the quantity of unique SRCs in a given status with the SRC’s Combat Load (CL) it was possible to build a unique munitions requirement for each time period.  As a process improvement, the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) is developing an automated and repeatable method to provide a quick-turn capability to construct an SRC time-line traversed with SRC specific resources to present an aggregated time sensitive look at changing requirements. By looking beyond the initial intended use of modeled output (MARATHON and FORGE) and identifying the type of data generated from each model, it was possible to restructure existing information to examine requirements and respond to supplemental queries outside the scope of the initial study parameters.","005_Smith_CAADE__QWARRM-Combat_Load_Tool_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

A constraining factor that is often underestimated is how the forces got to the fight. While the Atlantic and Pacific oceans have provided natural barriers to invading enemies at home, they present a logistical problem that must be solved before we can deploy U.S. Military forces into hostile areas of operations. When planning a campaign, it is important for the warfighter to understand the impact Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS) operations would have on the timing, type and quantity of forces commanders will have available in the early stages of operations. Modeling the flow of various force packages through JLOTS operations clarifies a key factor that would impact the planning of a successful operation. In support of the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) campaign planning, the Deployment and Enablers Division (DE) developed a quick flow analysis (QFA) simulation tool that explicitly models intra-theater transportation. JLOTS operations use a constrained set of Army and Navy assets to move cargo from an Intermediate Staging Base (ISB) to shore at austere or damaged ports or beaches. By modeling the expected force flow, it can be determined when units would be available to participate in the warfight. Modeling various force packages and flow priorities through these operations provides the decision maker a better understanding of the impact intra-theater logistics constraints have on the campaign when this is the only avenue for troop entry.","006_Hatch_CAADE_Identifying_the_Risks_JLOTS_Operations_have_on_the_Timing_of_a_Campaign_AORS_2016_(ILAS)_FDO_Signed.txt"

This presentation will describe the Army M&S CPR process and results; demonstrate how AMSO facilitates Army Enterprise M&S solutions for critical Army M&S needs; how the process enables communication and sharing between Army communities, Joint, and Industry partners; and provides long term prioritized planning for M&S needs to address Army strategic goals. The M&S CPR identified 394 Army M&S tools in active use and M&S enterprise gaps in the following areas: Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN); Cyber / Electronic Warfare (EW); Fires; Intelligence; Network; Resourcing; Sensors; Terrain; and Workforce. Working groups for each M&S gap area were formed to analyze and refine gaps, identify the communities impacted, and discover ways to close gaps meeting Army needs and mission requirements. In February 2016, the working groups and stakeholders were brought together in Fort Belvoir, VA for the first annual Army M&S Gaps Forum to discuss M&S gap resolutions. The resultant courses of action provided to the Army M&S Governance Forums included recommendations for policy updates, procedure changes, capability sharing, studies for new research and methodology development, and improvements to existing models and simulations. The processes and results documented in this presentation will provide attendees with: A method to assess capabilities distributed across multiple organizations, commands, and communities; insights on Army M&S gaps, areas needing support from Joint Services, DOD, and Industry; and the Army enterprise approach to M&S capability gaps and how to get involved.","007_Traylor_CAAAMSO_M_S_Capability_Portfolio_Review_and_Gap_Analysis_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

The initial CPR efforts recognized fourteen M&S gaps specific to the areas of intelligence and sensors, which impacted multiple Army communities (Acquisition, Analysis, Experimentation, Intelligence, Test and Evaluation, and Training) and prevent meeting Army mission needs. A working group was developed, leveraging intelligence and sensor subject matter experts from Army and Joint stakeholders, to define the M&S gaps, prioritize these gaps, and recommend courses of action for delivering M&S capability. This presentation will cover the M&S CPR gap process used, provide an overview of the 43 refined intelligence and sensor gaps, expound on the top 9 prioritized gaps, and summarize the recommended courses of action, which will be presented to the U.S. Army M&S Governance Forums. The M&S CPR Gap process will be a continuing effort with annual Gap Forums designed to gather M&S gaps and recommendations for gap closures.","008_Traylor_CAAAMSO_Intelligence_and_Sensors_M_S_Gap_Analysis_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

The efficient use of these facilities to integrate live and simulation-based training will assist the Army in maintaining its desired level of readiness under the shadow of diminishing training dollars. It is unclear whether or not the Army’s investment in MTCs is being utilized to its full capacity given that a set of standardized metrics to measure MTC capacity does not exist. In an effort to ensure these resources are being utilized to their full capacity the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (VCSA) has requested that the Center for Army Analysis (CAA), in coordination with G-3/5/7, develop a way to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the Army’s MTC investment. The MCTA seeks to develop quantitative metrics to measure MTC utilization and capacity and provide insights into the effectiveness of the MTC facilities to accomplish the training mission. Six installations with MTC facilities have been selected to provide data supporting capacity metrics to measure the three primary resources that define MTC capacity: manpower, classroom space and equipment.","009_Pannell_CAARA__Mission_Training_Complex_Analysis_(MTCA)_AORS_2016_FDO__Signed.txt"

Considerations for this adaptation include current operational tempo, strategic guidance, and end-strength constraints. Typically, TAA identifies a target force structure for the end of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and force managers determine how the Army’s mix will change from the current structure to achieve the target structure by the end of the POM. During TAA19-23, Army senior leaders requested analysis of the “total required force”, which required a close look at the unresourced force structure (Component/COMPO 4). This presentation describes how CAA developed a methodology to address force structure risk, assess sensitivity of inventory requirements to parameter changes, and to inform COMPO 4 discussions between the Director of Force Management, the Army G3, and the Chief of Staff of the Army. The methodology developed includes a means of identifying unresourced units in planned Army structure, corresponding personnel requirements and an overall cost analysis on planned operating force structure.","010_Adams_CAAFSA_Component_Four_Requirements_Through_Empirical_Research_(COMFORTER)_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

The Army is moving away from Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN), a readiness model that acted as an assembly line, providing forces to a known and stable demand, towards a more flexible model in Sustainable Readiness (SR). Facing an uncertain future threat, the Army needs to ensure a ready force that is responsive to whichever crisis may arise. The initial focus of the SR process is on early deploying units, which require a higher state of readiness and may therefore be required to be in the Active Component (AC). In support of the effort to improve the Army’s strategic readiness, the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) has developed an algorithm designed to parse Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDDs) associated with Operations Plans (OPLANs) created by the Combatant Commands to determine daily unit requirements by type and highlight early deployer requirements across multiple TPFDDs. Readiness and inventory must be managed not only for major combat units like Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), but also for hundreds of enabler units, eliciting the need for an automated tool. CAA provides daily unit requirements to the SR process and to Total Army Analysis (TAA) to inform unit readiness requirements and COMPO decisions. Defining and quantifying future threats in terms of early deployer requirements will help the Army ensure it is ready to win the Nation’s future wars.","011_Kuchel_CAAFS_Early_Deployers_Informing_Readiness_and_COMPO_Decisions_(EDTA)_FDO_Signed.txt"

Tool for Assessing Demands Met Under Different Inventories (TADMUDI) is a tool under development at the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) designed to support these TAA force structure shaping decisions. Intended for use by the Army G-37/FM OIs, this tool will enable rapid assessment of demands met through adjustments to the Army inventory. Based on sponsor requests for simplicity, the initial version of this tool will leverage Excel to enable static assessment of demands met by Standardized Requirements Code (SRC) based on sponsor-directed Boots on the Ground (BOG) to dwell ratios. This simple approach represents a significant move towards improved OI understanding of the implications of changes to planned inventories to meet demands that are articulated by OSD-approved scenarios and vignettes; however, static assessments significantly understate the complexity of operational force employment. As an alternative methodology, CAA plans to extend the provided tool, leveraging the results of dynamic analysis that accounts for the impacts of Relief in Place-Transfer of Authority (RIP-TOA) between units and a demand signal which varies over time. Once both methodologies are developed, CAA will compare the static and dynamic results to provide a more robust analytic underpinning to Army force shaping decisions.","012_Flewelling_CAAFS_Rapid_Assessment_of_Force_Mix_Decisions_–_A_User’s_Tool_(TADMUDI)_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

In this talk, we will discuss an approach to discovering associations explanatory variables may have with the probability that the response variable will change. The purpose of such a model is to characterize not only the mean value of the response variable, but also the likelihood that the response will change to a particular value. We use operational data and Commander's Emergency Relief Program (CERP) spending in Iraq as an example of where this type modelling might be appropriate.","013_Jackson_CAAOA_A_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Understanding_Change_Mechanisms_AORS_2016_Abstract_FDO_Signed.txt"

With the goal of gaining strategic insights into different force structure options for the ANDSF, the CAA and RS teams collaborated on a hybrid wargame, incorporating a few systems into the predominantly seminar-style platform. The system / tabletop portion of the wargame enabled seminar discussion by allowing experts to talk through a more structured process, consider the sequencing of events through time / space, and visualize the issues. As with many issues of wargames in general, CAA and RS could not incorporate all the details and complexities of reality into the project due to the time constraints. The team worked closely with the sponsor to capture the acceptable amount of realism while being able to accomplish the mission. This presentation will discuss the general approach, methodology, the CAA – RS working relationship, limitations of the results, and the overall command satisfaction with the wargame.","014_Erdman_CAAOA_Resolute_Support_Force_1400_Wargame_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

With the movement of actions associated with war (espionage, sabotage, and other malicious actions) onto computer systems and networks we are faced with a difficult problem; too much information. Systems generate logs with thousands of entries a minute, network traffic flows non-stop, and hundreds of thousands of messages are sent per day. This has resulted in a data deluge for network defenders attempting to identify nefarious activity within all of the noise. Akin to insufficient data penetrating the fog of war we are now faced with an overabundance of data which obscures the intent and actions of belligerent actors. This presentation will discuss the data deluge and the big data sets it creates. It will then propose solutions on how we can begin coping with, and handling, the deluge by using automated processes and machine learning to assist in filtering, screening, and interpreting actions and behaviors on computer systems. A strong emphasis is placed on the human component of these systems and the unique abilities they bring which automated systems are unable to match.","015_Gellerman_CAAOA__Glare_of_War_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

These algorithms were first implemented in the mid-1980s and have undergone continuous development since their initial formulation. This project is a novel implementation of an AIS system written in Python and PostgreSQL and based upon the work of Hofmeyr and Forrest. It was completed as the capstone project for the Georgetown Data Science Graduate Certificate program. A training set of data was selected and the model created using a negative selection algorithm that is analogous to an immune systems T-cell and B-cell development process and antibody creation. Non-trained data was then ingested by the model to simulate the continued operation of the network. Trained detectors would trigger a response which would then alert an analyst of anomalies and potentially malicious activity taking place on the network. The algorithm is trained and tested on data provided by the Los Alamos National Labs Cyber Security Research Center. This data consists of 58 consecutive days of de-identified event data collected from five sources within Los Alamos National Laboratory's corporate, internal computer network. The data used includes network authentication logs, processes started by Windows-based desktops and servers, network flow data, domain name server logs, and known red team activities on the network. The uncompressed data-set consists of over 120 GB of data and 1.5 billion rows of records. This presentation will discuss how the large data set was handled, processed, and modeled. Performance results for the model and initial training sets may also be discussed.","016_Gellerman_CAAOA_Artificial_Immune_Systems_for_Detecting_Malicious_Cyber_Activity_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

We can illuminate the impact of installation services on readiness by careful examination of the historic prioritization of funding for installations and potentially highlight critical HQDA validated requirements related to installation services that may be underfunded. The Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy & Environment (DASA-IE&E) has expressed a commitment to ensure that installations provide the best services possible to support unit readiness. An analytical overview of the direct and indirect linkages between installation and service programs to unit readiness will help show the potential impact of funding below requirements levels. Analytical efforts include: Determining installation and service program linkages to unit readiness; develop a proposed prioritization matrix to help articulate the direct and indirect support to unit readiness; analysis of the Installation Program Evaluation Group (II PEG) service funding; comparison of funding levels to requirements in the past and the future to assess short- and long-term impact of deferred funding on Army readiness.","018_Boncich_CAARA_Installation_Readiness_Analysis_(IRA)_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

The decision aid resulted from a literature review that categorized methods based upon their data and software requirements, mathematical operations, level of effort, and historical cases of use. The authors identified that no single resource existed for a student or analyst to either explore methods interactively or match a method to their problem. This presentation should be of interest to analysts and managers that use multiple attribute decision making, which permeates analytical areas such as acquisitions, budgeting, and military planning.","019_Holzgrefe_CAAFSA_Decision_Aid_AORS_2016_FDO_Signed.txt"

These simulations use scripted Red fire plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the Blue/Green AMD defenses. The author has observed that in most studies, these scripted input fire plans are developed based on subject matter expert opinion with little to no analytic rigor, even though the results of the simulations are highly dependent on those fire plans. In addition, due to the complexity and runtime requirements of the simulation, typically only a few variations of the laydown or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are tested. In order to develop an analytically rigorous fire plan as well as a testing platform for different AMD laydowns and TTPs, a new analytic framework is required. This study will outline a wargame process to explore the relationship between Red fire plans, and Blue/Green AMD laydowns and TTPs. The output from the wargame will be one or more red fire plan(s) and one or more AMD laydowns that were developed in an analytically rigorous environment. This wargame methodology will explain the setup and conduct of the wargame as well as the adjudication process for the engagements. The surface-to-air engagement results are based on predictive models from EADSIM simulation runs in order to ensure a high level of analytic rigor. Additionally, damage effects calculations from leakers are based on AMSAA lethal area data and weaponeering hit/miss calculations.","023_Chang_CAAAir_and_Missile_Defense_(AMD)_Wargame_Methodology.txt"

AEWE supports the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) process with early prototype analysis. It is complimentary to other events in the campaign of learning and supports Force 2025 Maneuver objectives. AEWE 2016 was supported by ARCIC, all TRADOC Centers of Excellence, the Army Test and Evaluation Command, the Research, Development, and Engineering Command, the Army Material Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), the Army Research Institute, and the Joint Deployable Analysis Team. The Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) hosted AEWE from October 2015-February 2016. Forty-five technologies, nominated by both government and industry partners, were assessed during AEWE 2016. TRADOC Centers of Excellence collaborated to develop five experiment objectives. The objectives are linked to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWfC) and included the following five functional areas: situational understanding, small unit sustainment, mission command, lethality, and protection and mobility. The Maneuver Battle Lab led the analysis team that included members from. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE), Cyber Center of Excellence (CCoE) and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from the MCoE. The analysis team decomposed the five experiment objectives into Essential Elements of Analysis (EEAs), Measures of Performance (MoPs), and Measures of Effectiveness (MoEs). This process identified data requirements and served as the basis for both data collection and analysis. During the experiment, the analysis team collected data through various methodologies to include observations from SMEs, surveys, After Action Reviews, focused interviews and group interviews. Results of AEWE 2016 have broad impact across TRADOC, Army Materiel Command, and ultimately the operational force. The recently completed AEWE 2016 informed six Capability Development Documents (CDD), five Capability Production Documents (CPD), and one Capability Based Assessment (CBA). Findings will inform candidate selections for three programs of record. Three assessed capabilities are being transitioned for immediate availability to the force and three other technologies will be further assessed during the 2018 Army Warfighting Assessment (AWA).","20160613_Forgie__TRAC_MCOE__Army_Expeditionary_Warrior_Experiment_-_AORS_2016_Abstract_(UNCLASSIFIED).txt"

In the modern era of software-intensive and software-only acquisition systems, widgets are made of software. Finding the root cause of a malfunction requires an entirely different skill set -- and an entirely different approach to data collection-- than has been previously required in test and evaluation. In this presentation, we will explore the growing role of data science in test and evaluation, particularly with respect to fault-tracing and root-cause analysis across multiple interfaces (hardware and software, virtual and physical machines, servers and clients, seen and unseen processes, and the like), the use of server and system logs as a data source, and test planning implications. These will be accompanied by examples and lessons-learned from multiple system tests.","20160705_Bauer__ATECAEC_-Growing_Role_of_Software-Intensive_Systems_in_TnE-Implications_LL_-_AORS_2016_Abstract.txt"

Since physical experimentation is expensive and limited, the Arm relies on computer simulation to help decide how best to equip, man, organize, employ, train, supply, and maintain the force. These computer models can be extremely complex, with thousands of potentially interacting factors and many sources of uncertainty. Efficiently exploring these high-dimensional models requires the effective use of design of experiments (DOE). Fortunately, recent breakthroughs in the science for exploring computational models enables much more powerful large-scale simulation studies. In fact, researchers and students in the SEED Center for Data Farming (http://harvest.nps.edu) at the Naval Postgraduate School are routinely doing experiments that were not available only a decade ago— often simultaneously varying many scores of variables of different types and levels. This presentation provides an overview of modern data faming and introduces a portfolio of experimental designs for efficiently obtaining insights from high-dimensional models. These designs offer the researcher both design and analysis flexibility. The design flexibility allows analysts to readily generate designs for a large number of input factors of various types within reasonable sampling budgets.

Various systems exist to measure the medical aspect of readiness and patient Access to Care standards. The Defense Medical Human Resources System-internet (DMHRSi) is the mandated human resources management tool for the Defense Health Agency and is the only Integrated Human Resources System within the Department of Defense. DMHRSi tracks provider availability time and provider productivity through relative value units generated by a patient visit. DMHRSi also tracks staff by specialty and office location in support of the MEDCOM mission. DMHRSi feeds the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS) through four digit functional cost codes. Identifying supply and demand for specific services is critical to MEDCOM’s mission and offers opportunities to increase productivity, access to care, and patient satisfaction within the system. Current measures indicate the DMHRSi human interface error is high. This presentation will provide an overview of a Regional Health Atlantic-Provisional study underway purposed to uncover misreported time errors, errors in MEPRS code usage, and discrepancies in DMHRSi transmission methods. The results of the study will inform future incentivizing in the Integrated Resourcing and Incentive System (IRIS).","20160706_JKaczynskiMEDCOMUsing_Defense_Medical_HR_System-internet_to_measure_CareAccess-AORS_2016.txt"

Peak targets items which are statistically not forecastable due to infrequent demand. Next Gen targets items with high demand frequency which are statistically not forecastable due to unusually high demand variability. THE PROBLEM Non-forecastable items represent significant financial and support risk. While some of these items simply do not justify the risk associated with stocking them, others must be stocked due to weapons system support or some other critical warfighter need. These non-forecastable items have traditionally been more difficult to procure, often because of long lead times. In addition, non-forecastable items have the greatest risk for both excess stock and stock outages within any given portfolio of items. If the risks associated with not stocking these items exceeds the risks of stocking them and forecast-based models do not offer a viable solution, then how does PNG determine when and how much to order? THE SOLUTION The PNG solutions enable quick decision making. PNG provides managers with trade-off curves showing the simultaneous three-way trade-off between customer service, inventory value, and the annual replenishment actions (buyer workload). By selecting a point on a curve, managers set minimum and maximum stock levels, on an item by item basis, to achieve projected business outcomes for the group. This approach replaces the inefficient, ineffective, and potentially costly process of attempting to forecast the unforecastable. It eliminates developing safety stock and order quantities from devalued data. After two years of applying PNG to 500,000 DoD consumable hardware items, customer service was much improved while inventory was reduced. Procurement workload was down significantly, contributing to shorter lead-times. The workload reduction was down in both buys generated and buys generated but later canceled. PNG reduced requirements churn and better aligned material bought and sold, resulting in an annual savings of $400M in working capital. THE FUTURE Under OSD’s Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Program (CIMIP), PNG was extended to guide buy and repair decisions for reparable items. We will present criteria for segmenting the Air Force reparable item population into sub-populations that perform best with Peak, Next Gen, and the current forecast-based process. We will show simulation results on applying PNG to their respective sub-populations, including trade-off curve options, near-term financial and workload impacts, and benefits for weapon system support. Air Force Sustainment Command is going forward with implementation of Peak, and is supporting further work to tune Next Gen for weapon system support and to interface with downstream systems.","20160707_Bachman_Carroll_LMRLMI__PNG-Improved_Inventory_Management_for_Items-Non-forecastable_Demands_AORS_2016.txt"

In November 2015, the US Army Africa (USARAF) Deputy Chief of Staff (DCOS) tasked the ORSA Branch to conduct a study of current USARAF hiring actions completed in 2015 to determine trends, identify problem areas, and recommend solutions to improve the current process. The study consisted of analysis of empirical evidence from 74 hiring actions coupled with a qualitative analysis of surveys completed by supervisors and recently hired employees to identify process choke points and areas for increased efficiency. The completed study was briefed to the DCOS, directorate leads and deputies, and supervisors. The analysis sheds light on areas of improvement in the current USARAF process and implications of unique requirements placed on USARAF hiring actions (i.e. overseas, passport requirements). Results from the study are currently being used to reevaluate and streamline civilian hiring in USARAF.","20160707_ClarkUSARAF_G5US_Army_Africa_(USARAF)_Civilian_Hiring_Analysis_Abstract_Form_-_AORS_2016.txt"

These procedures typically minimize the importance of the human-in-the-loop, limiting the art of the military-decision-making-process (MDMP). Normally, integrated testing enhances the operational realism in developmental test (DT) environments while the statistical confidence and power in an operational test (OT) is usually missing. Recognizing that IT systems are growing in complexity, the Management, Mechanics, and Math (M3) methodology and associated briefing format was devised as a way to think through and create testing that enables a more effective analysis, including both science and art. This systematic methodology can be used as a tool for conducting T&E of complicated information systems within the full range of military operations to: collect, evaluate, and understand data regarding system and user effectiveness through enhanced control of a chaotic operational environment, mimicking realistic environments.","20160707_Conley_ATECManagement,_Mechanics,_MathEnhanced_Methodology_for_Future_TandE_Complex_IS_AORS_2016.txt"

As White et al. (1976) argue in their seminal paper, “many different types of tie are needed to portray the social structure of a population” (p. 739). However, despite this foundational emphasis and several notable exceptions (i.e., Baker, 1986; Borgatti & Everett, 1992; Batagelj, Ferligoj, & Doreian, 2007; Brusco, Doreian, Steinley, & Satornino, 2013; Ziberna, 2014), the vast majority of published research over the past 40 years has focused on solving blockmodels for a single relation. When multiple relations exist, a reductionist approach is often employed, where the relations are either stacked or aggregated into a single matrix, allowing the researcher to apply single relation blockmodeling techniques. Nonetheless, this simplification can mask structural nuances within the individual relations. Moreover, while improved methods for solving single relation blockmodels have been immensely valuable and are implemented in popular network analysis software (i.e., Pajek’s incorporation of direct blockmodeling (Doreian, Batagelj, & Ferligoj, 2005)), they are ultimately heuristics. Accordingly, while they provide good, locally optimal solutions, they cannot guarantee that better fitting solutions do not exist. Again, there are several notable exceptions where researchers have developed and implemented exact methods (i.e., Brandes & Lerner, 2010; Brusco, Doreian, Mrvar, & Steinley, 2013; Brusco & Steinley, 2009); however, these methods exist for a single relation. Accordingly, in this paper we extend Brusco and Steinley’s (2009) exact procedure to the exploratory blockmodeling of multiple relation, mixed-mode networks. In particular, given (a) N1 actors, (b) N2 events, (c) an (N1 x N1) binary one-mode network depicting the ties between actors, and (d) an (N1 x N2) binary two-mode network representing the ties between actors and events, we use integer programming to simultaneously find the globally optimal (P1 x P1) actor-by-actor and (P1 x P2) actor-by event image matrices, along with their associated partitions. Given the computational complexity of this problem, we also develop an algorithm to generate a minimal set of non-isomorphic image matrices of size (P1 x P1 | P1 x P2) greatly reducing the total number of image matrices that must be fit when compared to the set of all possible (P1 x P1 | P1 x P2) image matrices. We illustrate these concepts using a simple, hypothetical example, and we apply our technique to a network of nations.","20160707_Dabkowski_USMA_Globally_Optimal_Macrostructure_in_Multiple_Relation_MixedMode_Social_Networks_AORS_2016.txt"

This presented several challenges. First, no other staff sections had responsibility for conducting assessments; thus they lacked a proper understanding of the process and had little incentive to contribute to it. Paradoxically, these same staff sections were responsible for planning USARAF’s intermediate military objectives (IMOs)—the framework by which the ORSA Branch conducted its assessments. Second, a lack of emphasis on assessments resulted in a shift from bi-annual to annual updates, which failed to provide timely and actionable recommendations for the command to impact and provide guidance on. Subsequently, the ORSA Branch found itself heavily engaged in preparing the campaign assessment for three months of the year, with little to no time or resources devoted to assessments for the other nine. Lastly, the assessment process lacked any automated data collection or archival capability. This resulted in excessive time spent collecting and synthesizing data and reviewing historical assessments to identify any correlation or trends. In August 2015, the ORSA Branch spearheaded the development of a new campaign assessment process to establish an effective, relevant, and repeatable assessment process that: • Focused on the commander’s objectives and end-state. • Identified and considered specific indicators in context with related factors and informed human judgment. • Ensured credibility by validation through a whole-of-staff approach. • Presented findings clearly and concisely. • Established context that linked evidence, arguments, and recommendations to the end state. • Provided an implementable solution that did not impose unrealistic requirements on subordinate elements. • Scrutinized relevant evidence and logic using analytic rigor supported by professional military judgement. • Presented unbiased results without a predetermined outcome. • Integrates the insights and expertise of all relevant staff sections and stakeholders. The USARAF ORSA Branch developed a framework that now serves as the foundation for future campaign assessments and plays a vital role in the planning and approval of all IMOs. Indicators of progress—quantitative and qualitative data points that inform the assessment process—allow the command to visualize conditions and effects and how they progress lines of effort toward specified end states, and the “risk to mission” assessment highlights potential pitfalls which may adversely impact the mission, allowing the command to proactively act, rather than react, to mitigate that risk. Through the Strategic Management System, a web-based application and the Army’s program of record for performance management, USARAF has institutionalized its data to provide auditable records that allow for longitudinal analysis of historical trends.","20160707_SanfordUSARAF_G5US_Army_Africa_Campaign_Assessment_Methodology_Abstract_Form_-_AORS_2016.txt"

The strengths and limitations of each tool will be addressed, and how the two tools can be used together in a study will be examined.","20160711_Appleget_NPS_Wargaming_and_Combat_ModelsComplementary_Analytic_Tools_AORS_2016_Abstract.txt"

These analyses employ a variety of models, tools, and techniques, take place in a variety of contexts—support of Live-Fire Test and Evaluation; analysis-of-alternatives studies; size, weight, and power trade-off studies; system and/or component design; basic research; and others—and are performed for a variety of customers throughout and external to the Department of Defense. Within this exceedingly broad range of analytical competencies is the DESCENT (not an acronym) rotorcraft autorotation optimization model. It is designed to provide first-order estimates of best-case autorotation capability for a rotorcraft suffering an arbitrary degree of main-rotor power loss. The software was designed to maximize computational speed and input flexibility, so that the widest possible parameter space (e.g. initial flight conditions, vehicle weight, rotor size and inertia, weighted priorities for landing states, etc.) can be feasibly considered in the course of an analysis. In its most basic utility, DESCENT produces a velocity vector that represents the optimized landing velocity for a rotorcraft in a given scenario. Typically the code is run iteratively over, at minimum, an initial flight-condition envelope of relevance to the analyst, and then DESCENT’s predictions are combined in some fashion to form an “average” end state. This value(s) can then used as input into larger-scope S/V modeling, as a metric to evaluate possible design changes, or for other purposes. One simplification in the original development of the DESCENT model was the assumption of a single main rotor that was the sole major lifting surface, as in the UH-60 or AH-1. This did not affect the code’s applicability to the majority of the Army inventory, and work-arounds were available for addressing the CH-47 or other two-rotor vehicles. However, with the inception of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program and its preceding technology demonstrator exercise Joint Multi-Role (JMR), the Army’s S/V analysis needs will soon require significantly more flexibility in terms of rotorcraft characteristics. ARL/SLAD has responded to this challenge by significantly upgrading the capabilities of DESCENT. Of greatest relevance to FVL/JMR support is the acceptance of a user-defined number of rotors at arbitrary locations; this enables explicit consideration of multi-rotor, coaxial, and other unconventional designs. Additional lift, control, and thrust sources are also possible; this supports tilt-rotor and pusher-prop analyses. The algorithm for predicting successful transition to steady, level flight at a reduced power level has been improved and made more robust in response to the additional power availability in newer platforms. The post-processing visualization scripts have been upgraded in order to better facilitate shifting between “active” parameters in a multi-dimensional analysis. Finally, support documentation has been updated for more productive collaboration within the broader S/V analysis community. This presentation gives a background on various Army S/V analyses informed by DESCENT, talks about the anticipated requirements of S/V models for the FVL and JMR programs, discusses the new capabilities of DESCENT in the context of supporting non-traditional rotorcraft designs, and lays out the various contributions to design and development of rotorcraft platforms that fast and flexible physics-based survivability analyses are positioned to make.","20160711 Drysdale RDECOM ARL AORS_2016_Abstract_Submission_AWD.txt"

However, if there was one and only one model to invest in – one with high return on investment and maximum versatility – it would be a reliability block diagram (RBD). In this presentation, the Army’s Center for Reliability Growth (co-led by the Army Evaluation Center and the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity) continues its series on high-ROI methods for system reliability analysis by showcasing the many applications of RBDs in test and evaluation – from allocating resources during systems engineering, to optimizing statistical risks in test design, to estimating system reliability, to estimating probability of failure-free operations during a mission that utilizes a set of systems. As systems and the environments in which they operate become more complex, a solid analytical foundation for understanding impacts arising from system reliability characteristics becomes essential. RBDs are a versatile and affordable option for filling this need.","20160711_OBrien_ATEC_Reliability_Block_Diagrams_AORS_2016_Abstract_Submission_Form.txt"

The lab that is defined as the system of interest is the PEVEL, which is a part of the larger GSPEL group of laboratories and test cells at TARDEC in Warren, MI. Mission reliability is defined as the probability that a system can successfully complete a specified mission, given that all mission essential equipment is “up” at the start of the mission. The two tests studied were observed in real-time throughout the development of this research paper and associated deliverables. The tests studied are variants of the “Cold Start” test which attempts to determine if a vehicle soaked in sub-zero temperatures can be started under normal procedures by the operator, simulating a cold-weather forward operating base scenario. During those tests, the test subject was a Navistar MaxxPro MRAP vehicle. Operational conditions of the test (temperature, wind speed, mission critical equipment and failure rates) are outlined, however, details of the test subject are not disclosed as part of this research (vehicle specific conditions and kits). The mathematical model used in this study is a direct adaption from the mission reliability product rule. All mission critical equipment was modeled using the exponential model based on their real-life configuration and executed based on the required time for mission success. This analysis took into account series, active parallel, r out of n, and standby configurations as the mission dictated. For this mission reliability analysis, the Exponential Model was chosen for modelling both test cases partly because of mathematical convenience due to a constant failure rate, as is the industry standard convention. The Exponential Model or “Constant Failure Rate Model” is used during the ‘Useful Life’ period of an item’s life, i.e., after the ‘Infant Mortality’ period before Wear out begins. The Exponential Model is most often used in scenarios where electronic equipment is present. An executable excel model was created such that TARDEC management and other users could determine the effect of different configurations, MTBF, and mission times would have on overall mission reliability. The model allows the user to enter the type of distribution or model, the MTBF, phase required, and information on the phases themselves. What results is an automatically calculated mission reliability figure. The mission reliability method, calculation, and potential uses are outlined. Included in this research is an addition to Dr. Jerrell Stracener’s process for mission reliability analysis: reliability return on investment analysis. In the return on investment analysis section, I propose a process and template to calculate the return on additional (standby) mission critical equipment in terms of cost savings from customer refunded work. Reliability analysis for the remaining TARDEC and other DoD test labs is vital to the long-term success of the organization, its customers, and the warfighters. Assumptions of Study: Reliability Requirement at test level. This allows us to conduct a mission reliability analysis as the “test” itself being the mission of the lab. This is also important as it is what the customer is paying for, regardless if it is internal or externally funded. Constant failure rate for all mission equipment. Because of the nature of the lab in the current state, reliability data has not been consistently collected. With the assumption of constant failure rate, I was able to rely on subject matter expert information related to the exponential failure distribution. All equipment up at t=0. This ground rule or assumption is important because it allows us to use reliability equations to conduct the analysis. It is an accurate assumption because the organization will not begin a test if there is a piece of equipment in a non-operational state. All equipment is independent. With the exception of cooling tower and electricity (which are garrison owned and operated), all of the equipment is independent of one another. For example, a failure of the main cell fan does not necessitate a failure of the exhaust hookup over the life of a single test. Each piece of equipment has 2 states. All equipment used in this particular test occupied only one of two states: operational or non-operational. Standby mode, as shown later in this section, indicates that the equipment is operational but not in use. Study conducted in April 2016.

BPG is an antibiotic shot administered one time at the start of basic training to eliminate streptococcal and staphylococcal infections that recruits bring with them to prevent further spread. It is not effective against viral pathogens, and has an average duration of 4 weeks. Here, we build models to quantify the extent to which BPG availability is predictive of ARD. METHODS: We fit and k-fold cross-validated four random forest models to surveillance data from 1991 – 2016 from six Army installations. Dependent variables tested were weekly ARD counts, weekly ARD rates, weekly scaled ARD rates and weekly ARD quintile. Covariates in each model were BPG availability, adenovirus vaccine availability, post, latitude, trainee population size, year, month, and season. Variable importance was measured by node purity, which is the mean decrease in the Gini index at each tree split. RESULTS: The best-performing model used ARD case counts as the dependent variable, and explained nearly 80% of the variance in the data with a mean absolute error of 8.01. Population size and year had the highest node purities, followed by installation and administration of adenovirus vaccine. BPG availability was the fifth most important variable and its node purity score was less than one fourth that of population size. BPG availability was not among the four most important predictors of all-cause ARD in any of the four models. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that BPG availability is not a strong predictor of all-cause ARD cases in military populations. BPG prophylaxis may not reduce ARD morbidity at the population level when adenovirus is well controlled. We recommend performing streptococcal infection-specific surveillance and analysis to examine the true effectiveness of BPG in this population. Simulation studies could provide guidance as to what alternative or concurrent interventions—including a revised BPG regimen— could further reduce all-cause ARD morbidity in military populations.","20160712_Ball_APHC_Does_BPG_prophylaxis_predict_allcause_acute_respiratory_disease_AORS_2016.txt"

That was necessary since for many decades, military operators/warfighters had no standard task language. In the 1990s, official Joint and Service task lists were developed, establishing formal, doctrinally-linked semantics for the warfighter. This language construct enables evaluation of individual system contribution to collective tasks (the singular source for System-of-System conduct), mission performance and effectiveness. Also since the 1960s, FoF models have employed combat entities with assigned, unchanging attributes. Interactions have focused on ballistic events, on pristine platforms, for kill/ no-kill outcomes. However, since the 1980s, platform models have existed to support detailed, mutable geometry so as to maintain a running status of component state space. This state space can be mapped to platform capabilities and then compared to task requirements per the formal task descriptors. In order to support a high-resolution FoF model demonstration, a commercial tool (EXTEND-SIM) has been chosen as the integrating implementation tool. Much of the model environment is based on Army-generated data bases and analysis codes (e.g., MUVES-S2). Specifically, 1] a three-phase mission will be described using the official Universal and Army Universal Task Lists (UJTLs/AUTLs) setting the official task/ conditions/ standards paradigm, 2] high-resolution 3-D solid geometric descriptions of the fighting platforms (> 3000 object pieces) in dynamic mode will be used to estimate damage/ repair interactions with ballistic, logistic, etc., factors, and 3] employ Monte Carlo methods for mission threads and interactions to gain insight into the statistical outcome space. We will describe and show some of the high-resolution metrics that are generated and some of the key remaining challenges.","20160713_BrayMorris,_Nelson_Associates_Building_an_Advance_Simulation_to_Support_High-Resolution_Force-on-Force_Modeling.txt"

UNCLASSIFIED  Abstract: Computerized Optimization Model for Predicting and Analyzing Support Structures (COMPASS) is generally used to generate a Level of Repair Analysis (LORA). The objectives of this analysis were to: capture test equipment usage between alternative maintenance concepts; and establish an alternative methodology of COMPASS use by evaluating the cost and usage of test equipment. AMSAA was requested by Program Manager (PM) of Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) to provide a comprehensive optimized supportability/maintainability assessment that addressed the maintenance and logistics issues associated with transitioning Abrams tanks from the SEPv2 to SEPv3. The effort focused on the maintenance and supportability of specific legacy, common , redesigned and newly designed Class IX electronic Line Replaceable Units (LRU) and Line Replaceable Modules (LRM) that define both SEPv2 and SEPv3 platform configurations. This effort provided an economic assessment of the diagnostic screening of the LRUs/LRMs at different repair locations with future off-platform test support equipment. Off platform test equipment was analyzed using the COMPASS model developed and maintained by the United States Army Material Command Logistics Support Activity (USAMC LOGSA). COMPASS is the Army's standard model for performing a LORA. Three scenarios were evaluated for the SEPv3 LORA. The first scenario (base case) was a PM defined combination of contractor and organic repair. There are three LRUs that were potential candidates for off-platform test support. The remaining 22 electronic LRUs/LRMs were assumed contractor supported. The Base case reflected three organic LRU repair and 22 contractor supported LRUs/LRMs scenario. The second scenario was fully contractor supported. This scenario did not utilize off-platform test support because all repairs were performed by the contractor. The third scenario reflected the optimized maintenance concept generated from COMPASS. The three LRUs that were potential candidates for off-platform test support followed the most-economical maintenance concept. The remaining 22 LRUs/LRMs were repaired by contractor. All three scenarios evaluated the off-platform test support usage. In combination with the SEPv3 results, two scenarios were evaluated for the SEPv2 off-platform test support. The first scenario (base case) reflected the current maintenance policy (followed current SMR codes). The second scenario forced all LRU repair at the field level. Results from the SEPv3 and SEPv2 LORAs were combined to show a total off-platform test support usage for the Abrams program. Results showed a potential cost savings by downsizing the number of test equipment at the field level and still reaching the target operational availability.","20160713BrownAMSAA-_Off_Platform_Test_Support_Usage_Brown.txt"

With basic shelter information, the model can predict the thermal energy required to keep a structure at a desired internal temperature and humidity setting. It also uses the predicted thermal demand in conjunction with the Environmental Control Unit (ECU) performance specifications to predict electrical power consumption which ultimately contribute to fuel consumption rates based on connections to a generator or microgrid. STEM was developed by AMSM as an energy analysis tool to support multiple projects and inform science & technology decision making across the Department of Defense (DoD).","20160713CarrierAMSAA-_Shelter_Thermal_Energy_Model.txt"

The AMSAA/DSTL DFAD work is part of an Integrated Survivability Project, which is executed under an Information Exchange Agreement. The intended output of the DFAD effort is a set of attack distributions that could be utilized in threat lethality assessments, vehicle survivability and force protection assessments, operational effectiveness assessments, etc. which in turn support Army acquisition decisions. AMSAA's Survivability Team co-manages and executes the DFAD task under an Information Exchange Agreement. The current U.S. Army standard attack distribution, the Combat Vehicle-Combat Performance Operational Assessment (CV-CPOA), was developed in the late 1980's and has several limitations including the absence of attack distributions for modern day irregular warfare. Similarly, DSTL has utilized the Whittaker Distributions, which were derived from land attacks in World War II. Given that today's conflicts do not resemble the open land warfare of past conflicts and the threat attack characteristics are markedly different (asymmetric, irregular, etc.), it make sense to develop attack distributions to reflect the variety of conflicts experienced today. As a result, AMSAA is working with DSTL to analyze various attack information from current conflicts as well as live/virtual/constructive combat simulation from U.S. and UK training developers, with the intent to develop entirely new attack distributions for both conventional (combined arms maneuver) and irregular (wide area security, etc.) operations.","20160713ChampionAMSAA._US_UK_Direct_Fire_Attack_Dist_Dev.txt"

How well an armor system holds up to multiple AP hits depends on the incoming penetrator details (size, velocity, mat~rial properties, etc.) , the spacing between penetrator strikes on the armor surface, and the details of the armor design. For all recent U.S. Army combat vehicle programs (FCS, GCV, etc.) requiring defeat of heavy machine gun (HMG) and medium caliber KE penetrators, part of the requirement calls out a minimum allowable hit spacing (MAHS) when qualifying an armor system. Surprisingly, these armor multi-hit requirements are in no way determined by factors associated with the likelihood of near-hits in real-world combat scenarios. Rather, they have been determined by the use of engineering judgment for the purpose of enabling laminated armor, spaced armor, and ceramic armor systems to qualify along with the heavier monolithic metallic armors. As such, it is unknown as to the influence this MAHS standard has had on ground combat vehicle acquisition programs in terms of cost, risk, and performance (e.g., weight, mobility, etc.) relative to crew protection and vehicle survivability. Additionally, current platform vulnerability, system survivability, and force-level analysis tools assess vehicle losses using an assumption that each impact is an independent event and do not account for cumulative damage on vehicles. It is well known that this assumption of independence is not mathematically correct; however, in the past, computer processing power and data storage limitations did not allow for the ""state"" of vehicle functionalities to be maintained within a system-level or combat model. Thus, there has been no real concerted effort to correlate armor systems with multi-hit vulnerability in combat scenarios. It is not well known how much of an impact this deficiency has had on Army decisions relative to crew protection and ground combat vehicle survivability assessments. A significant challenge to recent ground combat vehicle programs (FCS, GCV) have revolved around vehicle weight and the balance between protection and other critical functions (mobility, reliability) of the vehicle. It is critical that the Army has thoroughly characterized everything that influences Soldier protection and vehicle survivability, in an operationally relevant environment, given it is of highest priority in our vehicle acquisition programs. This study strives to contribute to the knowledge base to fully support Developing Army Force 2025 and addressing multiple Warfighter Challenges. The study will provide valuable data and information for which to base a potential development of a new standard for armor requirements and verification testing that is relevant for the operational environment. The study will also begin to address the long-term challenge of including the effects of cumulative damage in crew protection and vehicle survivability assessments at both the system-level and the operational effectiveness level. This effort may have long reaching benefits that force improvements to standard Army combat models. In addition, this study is directly applicable to the Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy's call for near-term (FY16-FY21) development of ""advanced composite armor'' and will provide valuable information to the Warfighter, potentially influencing requirements development, and vehicle manufacturers and armor designers based on the following objectives: • Understand impact of multi-hit/cumulative damage on force protection/survivability assessment at both system and small unit levels. • Provide sound analytical underpinnings for defining armor requirements/solutions/upgrades to current/future ground combat vehicles .","20160713CorleyAMSAA_-_Impact_on_Crew_Protection_Vehicle_Survivability-Armor_Multi-hit_Perf.txt"

Prior to this time, armored fighting vehicle (AFV) characterization was principally in terms of armor protection. However, in the late 1950s, analysts began considering two key additional factors when assessing ballistic hits: a] reduction in platform ability to move, shoot, or communicate, and b] measures relating to reduced mission effectiveness. To bring discipline to this task, workers on the current main battle tanks (M-47s and M-48s) generated a list of major platform components/subsystems. Approximately 400 entries were generated. In order to address factor a], a group of engineers was assembled to map the effect of each component/subsystem on each of the platform performance abilities (i.e., move, shoot, communicate). To address factor b], a number of missions was subjectively defined; for example, overwatch, attack, hasty retreat, etc. The influence of each performance metric to the successful prosecution of the mission was then established. By combining factors a] and b] a relationship was formed between component/ subsystem loss and mission effectiveness. These pieces provided the foundation of what was called the Standard Damage Assessment List (SDAL). Because of the size of the variable space (e.g., different missions, round hit location, hit dispersion, etc.), a sequence of averages was imposed on the core metrics having to do with platform movement, firepower, and catastrophic outcome. In the end, the metrics, all generated on the unit interval, were labelled probabilities and have been used to support wargame interactions for over 50 years. Today, much has changed in the characterization of warfare analysis. Engineering analyses have been structured for many AFVs in order to relate component loss to performance decrement. Military tasks (together with conditions and standards) are now codified for the Joint and Service worlds. Thus a clear linkage can be established between the status of platform components and each point in a time/task resolved mission. In this paper we will review the history of direct-fire Kill Probabilities, what issues have surfaced, and how new methods provide optional means for supporting a gamut of analytic needs.","20160713DeitzAMSAA_How_are_the_Army's_Direct-Fire_Kill_Probabilities'_generated__A_look_to_the_past_and_to_the_future.txt"

And there is no other #1."" The key to success is tackling readiness early in the system acquisition process where cost-effective design and logistics innovations can be readily implemented. Advancing system readiness involves pursuing three prongs: (1) Reliability; (2) Maintainability; and (3) Logistics Performance. If you improve any of these three prongs, readiness increases; however, the cost and time ramifications for each can be vastly different. Early engineering activities (thermal analysis, vibrations analysis, fatigue analysis, etc.), reliability growth testing, and load characterization are essential for the reliability prong. System geometries , Condition Based Maintenance, and common tools are critical for the maintainability prong. Lastly, for logistics performance, it's all about having the right parts and procedures in the right place at the right time. The vastness of the trade space associated with these three prongs can be overwhelming without careful consideration of the quantifiable attributes and relationships of each. This presentation will show examples of the underlying attributes and relationships and how they each provide critical information for determining the most beneficial solutions for improving equipment readiness.","20160713DorzeyAMSAA-_Considerations_for_Improving_Readiness.txt"

FOCUS was used to develop sensor field-level performance data that can be leveraged by Mission-level and Campaign-level combat simulations. The content of this briefing centers on the development of the performance data generated by FOCUS for the alternative sensor/mine fields and the assessment of their performance for the AoA. The methodology synthesizes multiple sensor types and nodes into sensor fields that can be represented as a probability of acquisition from a specified geographic location. The end product generated by the FOCUS model is performance data at the individual sensor, node , and field level that can be easily and rapidly incorporated into combat simulations of varying levels of fidelity.","20160713GestidoAMSAA.Using_FOCUS_to_assess_Sensor_Fields_for_DMTTSE_AoA.txt"

Benoit Mandlebrot coined the term “fractal” to define complex patterns which are self-similar across different scales. Through his lifetime of research Mandlebrot identified specific instances in nature that can be measured and expressed as fractals and further asserted that fractals are everywhere and that “fractal math can find order within patterns that seem unknowably complicated.”     Operations Research and Systems Analysis teams often undertake the weighty and ""unknowably complicated"" responsibility of developing an assessment methodology to help decision-makers understand the current environment and inform decision-making. These assessments, conducted at all levels of war, can face significant contention regarding what to measure, how to measure, and how to combine the measurements into a coherent product for the decision-maker, leading to frustrated leaders and staffs alike. While not all-encompassing, fractals may provide insights into developing strategic and operational level assessments using tactical level patterns or explaining assessment methodology.","20160713_Gilliam_AWC_The_Roughness_of_Assessments-Leveraging_the_Concept_of_Fractals_AORS_2016.txt"

Through the planning, preparing, conduct, and reporting on strategic wargames, the USAWC is able to provide information and insights into issues of a national or military strategic nature to inform decision-making of the senior-most leaders of the US Army, our fellow Services, and across the Joint Force. The USAWC conducts approximately 7-8 wargames per year, principally for the Army Staff, Army Service Component Commands, Combatant Commands, and occasionally other DoD and government organizations. From the USAWC’s perspective, a strategic wargame is a structured, facilitated interaction between experts on a topic that will inform and assist in future strategic decision making by improving understanding of the pertinent issues. Results from a wargame can provide insights and options on the employment and appropriate application of the instruments of national power. Through the Strategic Wargaming Series, the USAWC conducts timely and relevant wargames to address select issues of strategic importance to the US Army and the nation. USAWC usually conducts its wargames on behalf of a sponsor to investigate, research, or analyze issues or areas that other organizations are not typically addressing. These wargames commonly deal with political-military issues at the high operational to strategic levels of war. USAWC wargame participants include highly qualified experts from the USAWC staff, faculty and students, US and foreign government departments and agencies, non-governmental organizations, other academic institutions, and relevant think tanks from around the world. For USAWC and the participants, there is inherent value in the exchanges of ideas and critical thought among a highly qualified, diverse array of wargame participants. USAWC wargames help to build and expand professional networks for regional and functional communities of interest.","20160713_Gilliam_USAWC_United_States_Army_College_Strategic_Wargame_Series.txt"

Combat simulations need to compute target presented area for every possible sensor - target pairing for each unique aspect and elevation ·angle. As such, a low cost, rapid method of calculation is required. Currently, systems are represented using simple shapes with accurate front and side presented areas and heights, and the intermediate areas are calculated using basic geometric equations. This presentation will explore the error associated with these methods for multiple system categories along with alternative methods of generating the data to include variations on the box and ellipsoid methods as employed today, the introduction of new simple shapes, and computer-aided design models.","20160713HairfiledAMSAA._Eval_of_Target_Rep_Methods_for_Target_Acquisition.txt"

FOCUS has been utilized in several Army and Joint studies to rapidly perform comparative analysis of sensor performance at the tactical level. FOCUS 2.0 is the first major update to the simulation which will completely overhaul the software architecture to increase the terrain ""play-box,"" enable increased flexibility in defining ISR asset collection behaviors, and generate output charts during simulation execution to eliminate or reduce post-processing times. The new architecture is centered around an entity and capability ""add-in"" relationship and a new process flow interface to allow users to build a variety of custom behaviors including target acquisition timelines, dynamic mission sets, and intelligence processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) flows. Development also includes the creation of the Tactical ISR Performance Suite {TIPS) that encapsulates the AMSAA ISR performance methodologies into a standalone Application Programming Interface.","20160713HarclerodeAMSAA._FOCUS_2_0_Development_Update.txt"

The power aperture product (PAP) Figure of Merit (FOM) was used to assess potential tactical ballistic missile (TBM) capability based on the preliminary radar hardware designs. The power aperture form of the Radar Range Equation provides a way to assess the salient radar parameters given the requirement to search for a target of certain radar cross section at a desired range over a solid angle volume in a given amount of time. A required PAP was computed for a given search problem (search area, required acquisition , and threat). The required PAP was then compared to the PAP of the radar design to assess the TBM capability. The assessment varied a simple ballistic trajectory using different initial velocities and angles to represent different classes of TBMs. The study assessed the timeline to determine the firm track range and PAP needed to intercept at different altitudes for a given interceptor. By categorizing the threat classes the study scoped potential capabilities of the hardware designs to inform acquisition decisions early in the process.","20160713HarclerodeAMSAA._Radar_Figures_of_Merit_Modeling.txt"

UNCLASSIFIED  Abstract: For years, defense industry partners have raised concerns that LPTA source selection has been inconsistently and sometimes improperly applied. They argue that this inconsistent and improper use of LPTA impacts the equity balance between the Department of Defense (DoD) and industry: DoD's objective to get the right product or service at the right time for the right price, with industry's objectives to provide value and excellence in services and products while sustaining profitability. Recent DoD guidance and initiatives have attempted to strengthen the use of LPTA and to ensure it is only used in appropriate situations. This analysis provides a comparison of best value source selection approaches (LPTA and Tradeoff) in the areas of usage, process, and impacts to industry and the Army. The analysis shows that LPTA is being used almost as often as Tradeoff in best value selections, saves the Army time and money, without greater adverse impacts to industry.","20160713HenryAMSAA-_LPTA_Source_Selection_Study.txt"

However, each tool’s classification performance is usually not entirely known and may only be estimated, in some cases, by in-depth manual analyses of tool alerts because labeled datasets identifying network data as malicious, anomalous, or normal are limited, and attacks are evolving in ways that are often indistinguishable from normal traffic. In addition, constraints on computational resources may exist, where meeting system-level efficiency requirements help to ensure situational awareness. We consider computational resources to be costs, and we define a Computational Resources Cost Index (CRCI) to characterize the IDPS efficiency with one metric that depends on memory usage, I/O, network, and tool run time. With a simple IDPS return on investment (ROI) model, we demonstrate how to measure an individual tool’s contribution to system-level performance, in a technological rather than financial context. We reveal that IDPS efficiency and effectiveness for multiple tools and datasets may be combined into a single measure, ROI, for relative comparison. Our suggested modeling approach is broad enough to be applied to different types and configurations of network and/or host-based cyber security systems. We simulate the ROI for a network intrusion detection system (NIDS), consisting of anomaly and signature-based tools, applied to real-world normal, background, and Botnet network traffic from the CTU-13 Scenarios, where each Scenario is a packet capture of network traffic. With these 13 malware scenarios, we measure ROI at the individual detection tool level and at the NIDS-level, and we show how our ROI modeling approach can be used as a decision aid for determining whether an IDPS or individual tool requires enhancements to meet objectives.","20160713__LeslieRaytheon,_Army_Research_LaboratoryFrom_cyber_security_system_effectiveness_and_efficiency_to_ROI.txt"

NRMM has been used by the U.S. Army and NATO for over 40 years to predict ground vehicle mobility performance. During this time , NRMM has been modified to meet evolutionary modeling and simulation demands; however, most of the terrain characterization has not been updated since the mid-late 1970s. As a result, the existing terrain data does not represent key scenarios defined by the Support to Strategic Analysis (SSA) process in the FY17-21 Defense Planning Guidance. AMSAA worked with members of the Joint community to build a new playbox scenario terrain in an Area of Interest (AOI) that is synchronized across the Joint combat simulation community. The methodology allows AMSAA to leverage high resolution satellite imagery and remotely-sensed Geographic Information System (GIS) data to better inform the Joint acquisition enterprise. The new NRMM terrains will help decision makers understand ground mobility performance (and the impact on combat operations) across a range of alternatives in a terrain that represents the platform's intended operational environment. Additionally, by synchronizing the NRMM terrain generation process with Joint Scenario AOI locations, new synergies will be created enabling combat modelers to reflect system-level capabilities and limitations in force-on-force combat simulations environments; thereby, generating new insights into operational system performance.","20160713LucashAMSAA._Improving_Force_on_Force_(NRMM)_Terrains.txt"

The Maneuver Support Battle Lab created a constructive simulation environment in OneSAF to perform multiple runs, control variables, and generate sufficient data. This presentation will focus on the use of constructive simulation for analysis. Various vignettes of Route Reconnaissance and Checkpoint Operation missions were developed in OneSAF to examine the impact on overall operational effectiveness of the differences in Risk and Performance by platform and configuration. Measures of merit focused on how well the alternative platforms performed with respect to Survivability, Protection and Lethality. The constructive simulation data provided statistically relevant results that will arm the MP School with information about each platform’s capabilities to determine which will best support the future MP force.","20160713McCluskeyManeuver_Support_Battle_Lab.Constructive_SIM_in_OneSAF_of_MP_Vehicles.txt"

Both older models (such as General Full Spray and CASRED) and newer ones (such as ICEM and JMAE) have assumed that all fragments from a given munition have the same shape. Meanwhile, measurements and studies at the Army Research Laboratory and Natick Soldier Center have shown that such fragment shape factors follow a distribution : sometimes normal, sometimes log-normal, sometimes other. AMSAA modified the CASRED and ICEM models to accept distributions from these studies, plus distributions supplied by the Aberdeen Test Center. Comparing variable shape factor model results with those using a fixed shape factor, AMSAA found that although there is some difference in probability of incapacitation versus range averaged over all azimuth angles from the burst, there are angles at which using a fixed shape factor can lead to significant overconfidence in the effectiveness of an armor system in protecting the soldier against fragments.","20160713RosenblattAMSAA-_Variable_Shape_Factor_in_Casualty_Estimation.txt"

WSTAT takes many factors of the subsystems into consideration and generates multiple alternatives for performance and cost trades analysis. However, this tool is very resource demanding in terms of upfront workload. AMSAA Mobility Team was tasked with generating several thousand outputs for cross-country mobility using the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM) in a very short, unmanageable timeframe under normal processing circumstances. AMSAA Mobility Team developed the System Level Analysis Mobility Dashboard (SLAMD) which simplifies data modeling and streamlines the simulation and reporting process for mobility analysis. In order to provide support for WSTAT, an optimization module was developed within SLAMD to complete the modeling runs. SLAMD allowed AMSAA Mobility to successfully deliver the analysis results on time, which would have otherwise been impossible.","20160713Song_DelgadoAMSAA-Optimization_Process_in_Support_of_Whole_Systems_Trade_Analysis_Tool_(WSTAT).txt"

For direct-fire fragmenting munitions, AMSAA calculates a P(I) estimate for many combinations of posture, clothing/armor/helmet, casualty criterion, firer-to-target range, burst height, burst-to-target azimuth angle, and burst-to-target range. Even for a modest number of munitions (11 ), the amount of data can be overwhelming (76 million P(I) estimates). By training neural networks to learn the P(I) values, AMSAA has developed a scheme to compress the data by a factor of one thousand or more with no significant loss in accuracy. Smaller data sets could ease some of the burden of data management on AMSAA's data customers, as well as take up less memory in their simulations. Neural networks - and other ""machine learning"" algorithms such as genetic algorithms and classification trees - have been used by the Army in many applications besides compression, including predicting the terminal ballistics of kinetic energy projectiles, searching for optimal vehicle configurations, designing new fragmenting warheads, detecting data outliers, and predicting risk. Use of High Performance Computing will also be discussed.","20160713_WayAMSAA_Data_Compression_by_Neural_Network_Regression.txt"

This requires more and more analyses, such as Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs) , to be conducted early on in systems' lifecycles, sometimes while they are still just an abstract idea. Delivering meaningful results early in the lifecycle can be challenging , but these analyses have the potential to shape important decisions that can impact a system's cost, schedule, and performance for decades to come . Reliability can be a key driver of a system's operating and sustainment costs which commonly account for a majority of the costs over the life of the system. Assessing reliability and failure risk early on in the lifecycle can ensure that the alternatives selected and developed deliver the required reliability while keeping a system on schedule, at cost, and performing properly. AMSAA has developed two methodologies to assess reliability early in the lifecycle. One, the Reliability Scorecard , is focused on the vendor's practices, processes and procedures and has been vetted by industry and used for years. The other methodology, which this paper will focus on, was developed to evaluate the failure risk of a system based on an understanding of the system design and intent, common failure modes, and Physics of Failure (PoF) practices. In-depth engineering analyses are just not feasible at this stage of the lifecycle when a system has yet to be designed in full , let alone tested . Instead , the methodology depends on analyzing the design's mechanical subsystems, materials, technology, and operational environment to identify potential failure modes and assess the risk of failure precipitating. This method provides a means to evaluate and analyze a system's risk of failure. This knowledge can be used to make effective decisions early on in the lifecycle to determine the direction a program should take and draw attention to any glaring concerns. Addressing reliability early on in the lifecycle enables the program to develop corrective actions and mitigate risk before failures are realized , saving the Army time and money and delivering a better product to the warfighter.","20160713WernerAMSAA-_PoF_Design_Risk_Methodology.txt"

The PGK fuze contains GPS guidance and small aerodynamic fins to correct the munition in flight to follow a path to the programmed target location. Artillery delivery accuracy has always been modeled to fit a bivariate normal probability distribution which has agreed fairly well with unguided artillery test results . PGK recently underwent operational and lot acceptance testing to characterize its delivery accuracy distribution against its required delivery accuracy of 50 meters circular error probable (CEP). Analysis of the PGK live fire test miss distance data has determined it to not be normally distributed in range or deflection. An initial analysis of PGK alternative accuracy representations has been executed by AMSAA to lay out the options and highlight the benefits and limitations of each. Improving the PGK accuracy representation will ultimately improve PGK weapon effectiveness estimates which could impact operational PGK TTPs and theater ammunition analysis.","20160713ZollerAMSAA._Precision_Guidance_Kit(PGK)_Alt__Accuracy_Dist.txt"

As military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to change from stability and wide area security to a lower demand train and assist mission, the Army can refocus on offense and defense tasks. Staff sections throughout major headquarters (HQ) are now returning to or relearning root doctrine. However, ORSAs do not have the same foundation as fellow combat arms officers. ORSA’s are learning where we fit into the HQ’s staff as well as how to best support current operations in both the garrison and tactical environments. With a focus on the tactical environment while executing Decisive Action (DA) operations the Division/Corps ORSAs provide critical information and assistance in the targeting process. With input coming from the Assessments working (AWG) into the Targeting Working Group (TWG) and assisting with the decisions being made in the Targeting Decision Board (TDB) ORSAs have a unique opportunity to be a key piece to ensure mission success. The targeting process focuses on a 72hr mission cycle with the model of Assess, Decide, Detect, and Deliver. The ORSA team, with the support from the AWG, brings forward the base assessment that begins this process. The Operational and Tactical Assessment provides the current situation of operations as well as highlights the effectiveness of the last 24hrs of the targeting cycle. This directly provides needed information into the Decide phase of the targeting process. Further, the ORSAs understanding and knowledge of the Detect and Deliver phases ensures overall understanding and maintains situational awareness of future operations and how they may impact future assessments. This presentation highlights and reviews the Targeting Process with a focus on the Assessments team support and input to that process.","20160715Bolke4th_Infantry_Division-ORSA_Support_to_the_Targeting_Process.txt"

The NTC, which began training troops in 1981, was established with two central goals: to train the rotational unit and to provide lessons-learned to aid in training across the Army. The NTC has been always focused primarily on the former, but has a rich history of efforts towards improving the latter. Ultimately however, these efforts resulted in a LL system that is largely qualitative in nature; despite many attempts to use the enormous amounts of instrumented data collected each rotation. This primarily occurred because of three factors: poor data quality, inadequate computing resources, and institutional resistance. I propose that a new analytical methodology which takes advantage of this instrumentation data from NTC is today not only possible, but would be a valuable addition to lessons learned processes by providing highly detailed, quantitative LL analysis that generally reflects operational realities.","20160715CadyUSAF-AFIT-Pardee_RAND_Graduate_School-Instrumented_Lessons_Learned_at_the_National_Training_Center.txt"

Our dependence on interconnected technology is overwhelming our ability to protect it. Part of security vulnerabilities of DoD NFC type of wireless network systems are inherited from the common security vulnerabilities of wireless network itself. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) systems are important resources where field data and big data are generated. We should give an extra breadth of considerations in assessing security vulnerabilities to support applications involving NFC/BLE systems. In order to pro-actively mitigating the common vulnerabilities of a DoD wireless network based NFC/BLE systems, a new security vulnerability assessment framework with additional metric groups are implemented. Through experiments, it can be demonstrated that the new approach is capable of effectively assessing security vulnerabilities common to wireless network based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) systems.","20160715ChanNO_FDO-ARL_SLAD_EW_Develop_Metric_Groups_to_Assess_Security_Vulnerabilities_in_a_DoD_Wireless_Network_Enviro.txt"

To meet throughput requirements, planners and logisticians need insight into system behaviors that are driven by diverse elements such as ship interarrival frequencies, availability of unloader resources, and physical characteristics of beach, lighterage, and causeway construction. The interaction of these variables create uncertainties due to system nonlinearities. This paper will address the components comprising a JLOTS facility, how the entities interact under challenging environmental conditions, and the logical processing of the behavioral interaction by discrete event simulation. A set of scenarios will range over known driving parameters and the system sensitivities will be teased out using visualization and standard statistical techniques.","20160715CowanUSAER_D.JLOTS_Discrete_Event_Simulation.txt"

This toolset has been the Army’s workhorse V/L model for 25 years and is constantly being enhanced to handle new requirements imposed by new munition types, additional damage mechanisms and improved vehicle designs. The BRL-CAD is the primary CAD package for vehicle modeling in V/L analyses and has had numerous capabilities recently added such as a universal geometry conversion utility and component datum’s. In addition, a semi-automated process has been developed to support the testing community in computing the striking presented area of an irregular fragment, a key measurement for the validation of fragment penetration algorithms. The MUVES has been recently enhanced in support of current and future acquisition programs with capabilities such as: multi-hit armor performance, incorporation of the Modified-Langley V50 distribution characterization developed in the testing community, assessment of stacked ammo, dynamic geometry, a polar grid technique or munition centric analyses, and an improved irregular fragment characterization/penetration technique supported by Joint Live Fire validation testing. The Army Research Laboratory’s Survivability/Lethality Analysis Directorate is also modernizing MUVES by updating to standard C++ libraries, exploiting current computer chip sets with multi-threaded analyses and vectorization, and a port to the Windows platform. These enhanced vulnerability/lethality capabilities will be described along with a brief set of upcoming features for MUVES/BRL-CAD.","20160715_DibelkaUSARLEnhanced_Vulnerability_Lethality_VL_Modeling_with_MUVESBRL.CAD.txt"

Despite the hardships of almost 15 years of continuous conflict, increased operational deployments cannot explain the magnitude or timing of the increase in disability loss. Two law changes including Concurrent Retirement Disability Pay (part of NDAA 2003) and Combat Related Special Compensation (part of NDAA 2008), substantially increased disability compensation and the incentive to seek a disability separation. Additionally, average ratings assessed by the Department of Veterans Affairs has steadily increased over this same time period further increasing disability compensation. Consistently higher disability loss necessitate additional recruiting and training requirements each year and drains valuable experience from the force. Despite the extremely sensitive nature of veteran’s benefits, military and civilian leadership should examine policies and law changes that could reduce the cost of the now consistently higher disability loss.","20160715MillerDAPE-PRS-DCS-G!-No_FDO-_The_New_Normal_in_Army_Disability_Losses.txt"

Recent events have shown that rival governments cannot only develop cyber-attack plans and implement them, but synch them to achieve national goals. The U.S. Department of Defense must begin integrating and normalizing the use of cyber effects. While there are numerous methods to begin the process, the key is choosing one, and beginning the long process of its implementation training. The level at which this training should be principally performed is at the U.S. Army Division level. Often, the division is the first major headquarters that can develop a list of requirements to submit to a Joint Task Force Headquarters or a Combatant Command. With that in mind, training the selected method at home station and during Operational level exercises is absolutely necessary. Simulation technology will catch up with cyber operations in due course, but this is no reason to not begin training now.","20160715Montgomery4th_Infantry_Division-Division_Cyber_Operations.txt"

With significant populations of contemporary Veterans transitioning to civilian life, there is an opportunity to adapt integration processes to preclude the risk of homelessness. Significant data is collected from Soldiers and Veterans at the point of military transition and intake to Veterans Administration (VA) care. This data can inform caregivers of the risk for multiple undesirable outcomes of military transition, including incidences of homelessness. With effective decision support tools based on this data, transition commanders and clinicians can better prioritize care, and possibly preempt incidences of homelessness. This project curates priority intelligence requirements aimed at identifying Veterans of recent global contingency operations who are at risk of experiencing incidences of homelessness after ending service in the United States Army. Having developed effective PIR, this project delivers an immediate decision support tool for commanders, transition supervisors, and VA intake providers, as well as the framework to automate that information collection and risk analysis in the future. Roughly 900,000 Veterans of service to Iraq and Afghanistan will transition home in this decade. This research supports efforts to enable successful transitions for high-risk Veterans, by effectively directing targeted care.","20160715MotupalliUSMA_Dept_of_Sys_Eng-_Predicting_Risk_For_Incidences_Of_Homelessness_Among_OIF_OEF_Veterans.txt"

As military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to change from stability and wide area security to a lower demand train and assist mission, the Army can refocus on offense and defense tasks. Staff sections throughout major headquarters (HQ) are now returning to or relearning root doctrine. However, ORSAs do not have the same foundation as fellow combat arms officers. ORSA’s are learning where we fit into the HQ’s staff as well as how to best support current operations in both the garrison and tactical environments. With a focus on the tactical environment, the division ORSA enhances HQ processes applying analytical skill in wargaming methods. 4ID uses wargame techniques before and during decisive action operations. Before operations, step four of the military decision making process (MDMP) leverages wargaming to measure each course of action (COA). From the perspective of game theory, Divisions and adversaries are players whose strategies of applying and risking combat power to determine outcomes in terms of control, create payoffs of military power and enable other elements of national power. Divisions are in a position to directly apply tactical land power as part of a unified action to defeat the enemy and establish conditions in which to achieve the joint force commander’s end state. Divisions bridge the gap between the science of war and operational art. During planning, the ORSAs collaborate with staff to develop a logical framework connecting strategic considerations with operational objectives and tactical constraints. The MDMP wargame establishes an expectation of operational success and refined risks and opportunities for each COA within this framework. The wargame also informs the ORSA of what metrics are important in identifying conditions for timing transitions. The result of MDMP is an approved COA of deliberate tactical actions planned to achieve operational objectives. During operations, the targeting and orders process further coordinates and refines these tactical actions in order to shape the close fight for the brigades. U.S. Division Commanders allocate limited resources to accomplish potentially competing outcomes for non-military pay-offs while in conflict with multiple competing adversaries and their often ambiguous and dynamic intentions. This estimation of current situation and visualization of tactical actions and counteractions resulting in desired progress is also wargaming. The commander should not need to do this alone. The Division battle rhythm is a series of events that collects and processes pertinent information to inform the commander. 4ID’s last battle rhythm event is the Warfighting Function Update (WfFU), where the battle’s next 72 hours is discussed among the Commander and his primary staff using only a map and whiteboard. This discussion results in refined guidance and directives for the Division. A Division’s application of wargaming techniques and generation of insight can help leaders make difficult decisions.","20160715Nesbitt4th_Infantry_DivisionDivision_Wargaming_in_Decisive_Action.txt"

With a focus on the garrison environment, the division ORSA is valuable to the commander by both leveraging an analytical approach for objective mission analysis, and communicating the results and insights to inform decision making. Garrison operations for 4ID ORSAs fall into three categories: command directed studies, Fort Carson health promotion, and analysis supporting staff. Command directed studies includes directed analysis, assessment, or review in support of division command team priorities. Fort Carson health promotion includes coordinating actions and developing collaborative analysis products to support the Community Health Promotion Council. This could include performing as a staff lead for developing programs to support the Installation Prevention Team. Finally, the ORSA integrates with key staff sections to apply problem solving skills, including research design and methodology development. ORSAs serve to provide analytical horsepower to overcome obstacles to the division mission.","20160715_Nesbitt4th_Infantry_Division-Garrison_Analysis.txt"

The Eagle training exercises test the KSF’s ability to protect and support their country from internal issues. Eagle V took place in October 2016 and looked at Kosovo’s ability to handle a significant amount of refugees fleeing from Syria. The cost analysis for a training exercise of this magnitude was unique for the KSF. Sparse planning assumptions, size, lack of familiarity, and language barriers magnified and complicated the usual ranges of risk and uncertainty associated with cost estimation. This paper will describe how a United States Army Operations Research and Systems Analysis Officer developed cost estimation tools for the KSF, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partner, to assist Kosovo’s military growth.","20160715_PageAWCCost_Analysis_in_Kosovo_v2.txt"

In any particular area, the number of young people available to be recruited into the Army in any particular area depends on population size, but also on local attributes of the population that affect eligibility (for example, prevalence of obesity or diabetes) and propensity to enlist (for example, proximity of universities). Obvious measures related to the number of people available include the number of recruits from last year and the number of local leads from that area. However, these measures all suffer from a “chicken-and-egg” problem. They all increase as a function of increased recruiter effort, and recruiters are allocated based on an area’s past production. In this work, we cluster about 34,000 ZIP codes according to their values of about 350 variables derived from open sources which measure data on health, income and taxes, local employment and payrolls, military and veteran populations, and secondary institutions. These variables are frequently missing, are often measured at county, rather than ZIP code, level, and are highly dependent. We reduce dependency and control for over-represented variable types (such as population health variables), by first partitioning the 350 variables into a small number of variable types and then clustering ZIP codes into a small number of homogenous clusters for each group of variables. We use a novel measure of inter-observation distance that is resistant to missing values, outliers, and transformations and operates on both categorical and numeric attributes. Performance is measured by comparing the clustering to the numbers of national leads, which should be largely immune from the effect of local recruiter effort. Recruiting Command can use the clustering to aid in assigning recruiting resources to, and determining recruiting tactics, in different ZIP code types.","20160719_Buttreyv2Naval_Postgraduate_School-Big-Data_Clustering_of_ZIP_Codes_For_Army_Recruiting.txt"

The military is bound by law to minimize any casualties to civilians and civilian objects, and has developed clear procedures and tools to help predict the collateral damage that may result from the employment of specific weapon systems under various conditions. These processes have been refined over time, and are now very effective for the planning of kinetic operations. The emergence of cyberspace as an operational domain is, however, adding new complexities. Evaluating the overall effects of a cyberspace weapon is less intuitive and more multifaceted to predict. Cyberspace capabilities have inherent differences in their behavior and employment that require additional study and scrutiny. These complexities, however, have been misconstrued and mythicized to the point where the perceived damage that can result from the employment of any cyberspace tool is often greatly exaggerated. Much like a biological agent is categorized based on its potential to affect a large portion of the global population, malicious software can be categorized based on its propensity to indiscriminately affect a broad range of cyberspace systems based on six attributes, namely: damage, controllability, detectably, remediation, exclusivity, and propagation. Furthermore, when decomposed, as part of a holistic collateral damage taxonomy, the processes for quantifying the undesirable effects that may result from the employment of many types of cyberspace weapons is not that much different than from their kinetic counterparts.

Many of the Army’s Science and Technology (S&T) initiatives are working towards efforts that can optimize logistics, including alternative fuels and power generation, autonomous systems, micro/smart grids, high energy lasers, alternative sources of water, and additive manufacturing. In order to assess which efforts can provide the best efficiencies, Logistics Innovation Agency (LIA) asked TRAC to conduct analysis to identify where and to what degree these S&T initiatives can generate savings. Many of the efforts are in a premature state of development, requiring certain assumptions to provide quantitative data. The study team used Tableau software to create a dashboard incorporating the Operational Logistics (OPLOG) Planner database to build units and scenarios.

Both breaches employed current suppress, obscure, secure, reduce, and assault (SOSRA) doctrine. This presentation will describe the methodology implemented in a COMBATXXI scenario to model the breaching of the two obstacle zones, challenges encountered, and solutions to overcome the challenges. Highlights will include how a custom behavior logger helped the study team quickly identify issues with the modeling, debugging of breaching behaviors, tracking damaged vehicles throughout the scenario, and performing calculations for analysis.","20160729ChavarriaTRAC.WSMR.Modeling_EAB_M113_AoA_Breaching_Methodology_in_COMBATXXI.txt"

The DMTTS&E AoA is considering new, policy-compliant alternative solutions. As part of the DMTTS&E AoA, the study team developed new materiel alternatives based on subject matter expert (SME) knowledge and directed guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This presentation will discuss the materiel alternative development process, including frequent consultations with the SME community to generate a list of all possible alternative components: (1) a screening process for reducing the number of alternative components and alternative candidates; (2) the refinement of attributes for evaluating alternative candidates; (3) the development of data collection tools and an analytic procedure to select final alternatives; and (4) a workshop to execute the process by which the final alternatives were selected for further analysis within the AoA. As analysts seek innovative solutions to address the military’s key problems under shortened timelines, future analysis may rely more heavily on the integration of human knowledge and subjective reasoning. This presentation will review the application of such analysis in the DMTTS&E materiel alternative development process. The key take-aways are better understanding of the importance of engaging the SME community and the value of workshops to leverage experience and information.","20160729DannehlTRAC-WSMR-Materiel_Alternative_Development_for_the_DDMTTSE_AoA.txt"

The intent for the AoA is to develop and assess a range of terrain shaping and area denial alternatives for the Joint Force that meet new operational and landmine policy requirements, specifically intended for use in deep countermobility operations. The United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) was directed to identify the operational benefit provided by the Gator mine system, assess the capability gap created by the loss of the Gator mine system, and examine the ability of potential nonmateriel options, such as existing and programmed Joint systems, to mitigate any gap created by the loss of the Gator mine system. There are six deep terrain shaping missions that rely on the use of the current Gator mine system which serve as the primary lens used to examine operational impacts and risks associated with the loss of Gator mine system. TRAC employed a qualitative-based gap assessment approach given constrained timelines and the requirement to deliver results early in the AoA. The approach relies on military subject matter expert elicitation to develop risk matrices to assess the gap(s). Analyzing this type of categorical data can prove challenging and the approach builds on the traditional composite risk technique. This presentation will discuss the methodology used in the study along with a review of the limitations, assumptions, various challenges, and lessons learned from the gap assessment portion of the AoA.","20160729DickersonTRAC-WSMR-Qualitative_Gap_Assessment_in_Support_of_DMTTSE_AoA.txt"

The analysis framework is based on the operations process and is designed to inform warfighter planning decisions by measuring operational outcomes of Friendly courses of action against possible Threat courses of action; e.g., most likely and most dangerous. Initial planning is done through an abbreviated military decision-making process, followed by employment of the force-on-force model to represent and support follow-on phases of the operations process which include prepare, execute, and assess phases. The desired result is an approach and tool to inform complex decision-making for relevant scenarios. This presentation will describe the development and components of BATTLES, explain how entity behaviors are modeled, and discuss the modeling framework.","20160729GallagherTRAC.WSMR.BATTLES.Development_for_a_Mission_Command_Analysis_Concept.txt"

The next generation of decision makers and staff will increasingly ask for “analytic tools” and interactive dashboards rather than static analysis. Tableau, and other dashboarding software packages, allow for the efficient production of such tools. This presentation will provide practical applications of dashboards built to automate and enhance analysis across multiple categories of data including survey data, operational data, simulation data, and cyber data. Examples will range from replicating and automating routine PowerPoint slides, to analyzing large sets of simulation data. This presentation will also demonstrate an enterprise level dashboard deployment at the Gallup Organization that automated and enhanced World Poll data vetting, significantly improving the depth of analysis and reducing resources required to process and analyze the data.","20160729HarrisTRAC-Lee-Upping_your_Analytic_Game_through_the_use_of_Dashboarding.txt"

Recent Russian operations and capabilities demonstrated in Ukraine and Syria highlight an advanced ability to target ground formations through various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance means and rapidly deliver massed IDF to achieve both tactical and strategic goals. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC) conducted the Counter IDF Kill Chain Analysis in an effort to examine emerging capabilities for countering or interdicting the threat IDF sequence of events, known as the kill chain, and to show potential operational impacts on mission success. The TRAC study team developed an approach that combined a thorough literature review with process modeling and wargaming. The team researched threat IDF kill chain capabilities to understand, decompose, and identify critical nodes vulnerable to disruption or attack; and used process modeling to assess impacts of the emerging capabilities on the threat IDF kill chain. The TRAC-developed Versatile Assessment Scenario Tool (VAST) provided the venue to assess changes in the friendly and threat operational effectiveness within a near-peer scenario. This presentation will describe the analytic scope, overall methodology, modeling and wargaming insights, and potential areas for VAST improvement to support future wargaming and analysis of IDF capabilities.","20160729KacirekTRAC-FLVN-Counter_Indirect_Fire_Kill_Chain_Analysis.txt"

Although combat simulations can be used in lieu of testing to expedite an analysis of alternatives, the performance data development process can be arduous. While this process is necessary to maintain the integrity of the performance data used in Army studies, one of the more common results are datasets that yield limited or no significant difference between alternatives. The objective of this Design of Experiment (DoE) approach is not to replace the data development process, but to generate representative performance data that can be tested within a combat simulation. In theory, this will significantly reduce the amount of time and effort lost generating performance data that may not differentiate between alternatives.","20160729LoncarichTRAC.WSMR.Design_of_Experiment_Approach_to_Fitting_Performance_Data_for_Testing_within_a_Combat_Sim.txt"

COEM’s deterministic simulation is designed for investigating human, social, cultural, and behavioral impacts resulting from changes in the environment. COEM can also be used as a simulation environment to integrate with models representing specific mission sets or capabilities within a complex operating environment. The model may be populated with data specific to a country or regional area of interest. The resulting interdependent and interoperable models provide decision makers with a deterministic outcome of the PMESII effects for military missions in a complex environment. This presentation will discuss TRAC’s approach to developing this capability as well as how this capability has been applied to support an inquiry into the effects of a proposed concept on a region’s PMESII environment.","20160729McMurtrieTRAC-WSMR-Complex_Operating_Environment_Model.Background_and_Application.txt"

The ability to extract valuable information from these large datasets is critical to leveraging their utility. Due to the often complex nature of these datasets, new and innovative methods have been developed over the past 20 years to aid both analyst and decision maker in using these new resources. This presentation will provide a brief survey of some of these methods, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and hidden Markov models. Additionally, the presentation will provide a review of Thomas Chadefaux’s paper and supporting analysis, “Early Warning Signals for War in the News,” and a TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) effort building upon his work and applying a hidden Markov model to his data for comparative analysis.","20160729MesicTRAC-WSMR-Analysis_of_Large_Datasets_Using_Innovative_Methods.txt"

Greater exposure to non-conventional threats drove the need for increased force protection levels across the tactical wheeled vehicle (TWV) fleet. Mobility levels decreased as a result of armoring the TWV fleet, reducing commanders’ flexibility to conduct missions both on-and off-road. As the Army makes decisions about how best to operate in tomorrow’s conflicts, they must provide commanders with an appropriate balance between force protection and mobility within its TWV fleet. The US Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC) is leading a study to assess current and required TWV force protection and mobility levels across the entire fleet. Brigade combat teams, echelon above brigade units, and TRADOC centers of excellence provided assessments on vehicle roles and capabilities in the context of changing conditions including threats, terrain, and joint operational phases during operational workshops. The study team will identify force protection and mobility imbalances by comparing operational units’ force protection and mobility needs with the current fleet’s performance data. These results will inform senior Army leaders and stakeholders to make decisions on future fleet requirements and strategies. This presentation describes the study’s overall methodology with a focus on the operational analysis.","20160729MillerTRAC-FLVN-Assessing_Future_Tactical_Wheeled_Vehicle_(TWV)_Force_Protection_and_Mobility.txt"

These efforts resulted in OSD CAPE directing the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) on 1 July 2015 to lead the execution of the DMTTS&E Increment I AoA. As part of the operational effectiveness analysis, TRAC conducted a Seminar Wargame in May of 2016, the purpose of which was to determine the operational impacts of the proposed materiel alternatives. To ensure the wargame produced valid outcomes, technical and tactical subject matter experts from over 15 Army and Joint agencies participated in the assessment of the proposed alternatives within the context of 2 vignettes. This presentation will discuss the wargame methodology, objectives, approach, and conclude with a discussion of challenges faced during planning and execution. The brief will highlight challenges associated with the evaluation of operational risk, analysis of operational versus tactical impacts, and the design of an effective wargame. Some background material on the AoA will also be provided for context.","20160729MooreTRAC-WSMR-Operational_Effectiveness_Seminar_Wargame_Challenges_and_Lessons_Learned_DMTTSE_AoA.txt"

In addition to this complexity, the experience level of an operations research analyst could limit their choice of visualization techniques to aid in understanding the context of the relationship of the results to the problem. Moreover, most analysts do not employ an abstract visualization design method that could enable them to validate their proposed visualization technique. In this presentation, we will discuss a methodology that uses an abstract visualization typology structure that will enable the analyst to derive the correct type of visualization to use in an explanatory analysis and validate the visualization is correct within their presentation context.","20160729MotenIIITRAC-MTRY-TRADOC_Analysis_Center_(TRAC)_Innovative_Visualization_Techniques.txt"

Increasingly, analysts are asked to evaluate capability gaps in support of Human Dimension initiatives. These initiatives require an amplified capability and fidelity to model and simulate the human in context. A paper from the National Academy of Science points to Agent Based Modeling (ABM) as the only type of modeling and simulation capable of capturing the human domain for analysis of human social, organizational, and doctrinal performance. A review of literature of ABM used in Human Dimension analysis will support this view. Implications for COMBATXXI, a form of ABM, will be discussed.","20160729NoelTRAC-WSMR-COMBATXXI._Leaning_Forward_on_Modeling_and_Simulating_the_Human_Domain.txt"

An important depiction of urban operations involves the use of behaviors in the simulation of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) to execute room and building clearing tasks. Movement to buildings with the Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century (COMBATXXI) model is performed through the Coordinated Maneuver Methodology Tool (CMMT). To simplify scenario developments and improve simulations of these TTPs, the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) is adding to COMBATXXI and CMMT behaviors that dynamically execute and manage operations for clearing rooms and buildings. A follow-on effort will apply Hierarchical Task Networks in support of decision-making techniques linking CMMT and generic urban operations behaviors.

Currently, satellite communication (SATCOM) is the only means for providing this connectivity when maneuvering forces are beyond line-of-sight of their command post, other units, and coalition forces. As the Department of Defense military wideband satellites reach end of life, the Services must be prepared to defend their wideband SATCOM requirements for a future wideband SATCOM analysis of alternatives. The Headquarters, Department of the Army G-3/5/7 initiated the Army Wideband SATCOM Bandwidth Study in November of 2015 and directed the TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) establish a study team to determine Army wideband SATCOM requirements to support deployed forces conducting expeditionary maneuver in the 2030 timeframe. The study team combined an extensive literature review, network connectivity analysis, and operational assessment to develop the Army wideband SATCOM requirements in terms of throughput by warfighting function and echelon. By combining the outputs from two different models, utilizing two operational scenarios, and current Army operational data, TRAC developed a baseline communication requirement. Subject matter experts (SME) were consulted to validate or construct communication requirements to fill data voids in the demand signal. SMEs also prioritized the communications requirements based on the missions and activities. The study team also examined operational impacts of transport convergence and threat jamming/scintillation on throughput requirements. This presentation will describe the study scope, methodology, and data techniques used to develop the estimated throughput requirement and insights on transport converge and threat jamming/scintillation. It will also outline various analytic challenges as well as lessons learned throughout the study.","20160729SandersTRAC-FLVN-Army_Wideband_Satellite_Communications_(SATCOM)_Bandwidth_Study.txt"

These considerations are not limited to Army-proposed capabilities, but often include Joint capabilities as well, complicating the comparison of the costs to employ materiel solutions. This challenge is especially acute when assessing costs of munitions delivered from platforms operated by one of the Army's sister services – strict comparisons of life cycle costs are inadequate. The analytic community and senior decision makers desire a method to compare costs to conduct an attack of a given target with alternative means that include aerial (rotary wing, fixed wing) or surface (ship, ground launcher) platforms. This presentation will focus on methodologies used by the Air Force and Navy to develop fixed wing operating and support cost estimates and how they may be used to develop mission costs that are equitable for all systems considered in an analysis.","20160729ShingletonTRAC-MTRY-Cross_Service_Fixed-Wing_Cost_Estimation.txt"

LBC is currently used for comparative assessments of force designs, weapon systems, vehicles or concepts of support with respect to their impact on military logistics, but it is also being developed into a decision support tool for planners and logisticians with a target roll-out date of 2018. LBC provides some distinct modeling advantages by nesting transportation, communication, and planning networks. It may run deterministically or apply probability distributions to obtain stochastic results, making it ideally suited for use with experimental design. LBC accepts input from other tools such as Force Generator (FORGE), Joint Integrated Contingency Model (JICM), Attrition Distribution Tool (ADT), and Operations Logistics (OPLOG) Planner. This presentation will cover the recently integrated Threat Impact Assessment capability, which allows LBC to account for attrition and loss of supplies and supply distribution assets as a result of enemy actions against resupply operations.","20160729ShockleyTRAC-Lee-Logistics_Battle_Command.txt"

SITS is designed to assist creation of dynamic scenarios by providing a suite of scenario development tools (force structure, unit layout, behavior (tactics, techniques, and procedures) development, communications, fires), and validation cues for correctness and completeness before the scenario is executed in the COMBATXXI model. A major goal of SITS is to provide new tools to decrease the time needed for scenario development. One such tool is the COMBATXXI Scenario Versioning System (CSVS), which allows multiple users to develop and integrate into a single scenario, near simultaneously, using Subversion technology. This has the potential to decrease the scenario development timelines supporting analyses of alternatives and to improve the integration process. This presentation will describe how CSVS will improve dynamic scenario development.","20160729SolisTRAC.WSMR.COMBATXXI_Scenario_Versioning_System_(CSVS).txt"

Traditionally, SAFs have limited organic capability to respond to emergency situations. They are typically visible and accessible to the civilian populace by their design, purpose, or location, as SAFs physically reside within a community apart from a standard installation. Examples of SAFs include Recruiting Centers, campus-based ROTC programs located within universities, and U.S. military activities that reside off-installation in federal, state, or leased facilities. The objective of this study is to help inform leaders of the current status of SAFs so they can develop Arming CONOPs should a threat arise requiring a decision to alter local force protection and security measures. This analysis is pre-decisional, so this presentation will address the study plan and methodology, while providing insight on how the study team overcame several challenges faced when conducting this complex analysis.","20160729SulewskiTRAC-Lee-Stand_Alone_Facilities_–_Force_Protection_Study.txt"

The study purpose was to identify the 2030 vision for MUM-T, determine desired capabilities and attributes for MUM-T systems, and examine feasibility of desired capabilities and attributes to meet the 2030 demand signal. Key aspects of the study included development and staffing of a 2030 MUM-T vision, identification of desired capabilities and attributes, attribute feasibility assessment, and a Threat and operational assessment. The exploratory nature of this analysis combined with time and funding limitations led the study team to rely heavily on Warfighter and technical subject matter expert input. Based on all information gathered, the analysis team delivered a stakeholder-approved vision statement, a list of desired capabilities and attributes, and near- and mid-term considerations for MUM-T capability development along with recommendations on areas to focus future analysis efforts. This presentation will discuss the study methodology including the measurement space workshop, Warfighter workshops and surveys, feasibility assessment, and operational assessment.","20160729WagnerTRAC-WSMR-2030_Manned_Unmanned_Teaming_(MUM-T)_Study.txt"

The MDTQC covers standard programs for operator safety, risk management, and accident avoidance. Course graduates become a certified Master Driver Trainer (MDT) responsible for planning and implementing their unit’s driver training programs. Through its graduates, the MDTQC aims to reduce the frequency and severity of Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) accidents across Army commands. The Transportation School asked TRAC-LEE to identify a correlation between their course and the TWV accident rate and thus determine if their strategy was working. TRAC-LEE leveraged a US Army Combat Readiness Center database of vehicular accidents to consider the impact of MDTs on US Army driver safety and TWV accidents. In addition, a survey of the MDTQC graduates was conducted to gauge their influence on unit implementation, including effectiveness and training. Using these lines of evidence, TRAC-LEE found a positive relationship between the implementation of the MDTQC and a reduction in the frequency and severity of Army TWV accidents. A similar relationship was found when classification, vehicle type, and geographical location were taken into account. This presentation will discuss the analysis and findings of TWV accidents before and after the inception of the MDTQC.","20160729WalkowiczTRAC-Lee-Analysis_of_Tactical_Wheeled_Vehicle_Accidents_in_the_US_Army.txt"

The 2012 Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) identified requirements for replacing the M113 in the ABCTs. However, there remain some 1,200 M113 Family of Vehicles (FoVs) in Echelons above Brigade (EAB) Field Artillery (FA) and Engineer Brigades (BDEs) without a plan for replacement. A 2012 Congressional Inquiry Study found that these units face high risk to mission accomplishment when operating with M113s. In April of 2015, the TRADOC Analysis Center was tasked to conduct an Analysis of Alternatives on the M113 FoV in EAB. The purpose of the AoA was to inform senior Army decision makers with analytic evidence to support requirements documentation and acquisition decisions. The development of replacement courses of action (COAs) was one of the most complicated aspects of the study. The M113 FoV in EAB serves in both general purpose and mission command mission roles, resides in two different branches and is employed from the squad level up to the battalion commander. The M113 FoV’s replacements need to fill the same wide range of capabilities at an affordable cost. The study screened hundreds of candidates to arrive at four alternatives: Stryker Flat-Bottom Hull, Stryker Double-V Hull, Mobile Tactical Vehicle Light with additional Force Protection, and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle. The study considered many combinations of these alternatives between pure fleet and mixed fleet, new procurement and reusing existing Army inventories. Using cost, performance, operational impact, and risk analysis, the study was able to recommend feasible and affordable COAs that mitigated capability gaps and met the warfighter’s needs. This presentation will discuss the study’s method for developing and evaluating its COAs.","20160729WildTRAC-FLVN-EAB_M113_FoV_Replacement_AoA_Course_of_Action_Development.txt"

The purpose of the AoA is to evaluate commercial off-the-shelf vehicle capabilities to enable the rapid employment of squad-sized light infantry forces. The TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) established a study team to examine the alternatives that could mitigate the capability gap resulting from the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) lack of sufficient enhanced tactical mobility to rapidly transport and maneuver forces across extended distances as part of a Joint Forcible Entry team in all environmental conditions. The GMV AoA Study Directive identified two study issues for the AoA to address: (1) assess the cost, schedule, and performance risks for each alternative considering life-cycle cost, weight, and size of a vehicle, and (2) assess IBCT operational effectiveness for each alternative considering maneuverability, fixed-wing employment, and rotary-wing employment. This presentation will discuss how the study team assessed operational effectiveness of the GMV alternatives by focusing on the transportability and maneuverability of the alternatives within two scenario vignettes, both involving offset drop zone/landing zones. It will include methodologies for the two efforts and outline various challenges as well as lessons learned throughout the study.","20160729WillisTRAC-FLVN-Ground_Mobility_Vehicle_(GMV)_Analysis_of_Alternatives.txt"

This effort is currently named the Defensive Cyber Operations Intelligence Support (DCOIS). As part of this pilot, the INSCOM ORSA Cell developed analytical techniques and tools that assist analysts in extracting relevant cyber data from intelligence data bases. These analytical techniques incorporate data fusion and entity extraction techniques using the R Programming language to produce a summary of cyber entities found in intelligence community databases. These entities are then uploaded to Cyber Situational Awareness Analytical Capabilities (CSAAC) to assess status and prioritize efforts. This tool increases the effectiveness of analysts in leveraging intelligence community data for use in Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO).","20160801BeskowIntelligence_Support_to_Defensive_Cyber_Operations.txt"

Efforts focus on countries, regions, adversaries and a variety of trends of concern to decision makers. While efforts are underway to develop collection capabilities focused on remotely characterizing cities, there does not exist…any analytical arm dedicated to understanding cities to support the war fighter.” Follow on research efforts identified “big data” as the cornerstone of intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) in dense urban environments. To support these claims, most research efforts point to the use of big data by industry and local governments, along with the explosion of mobile devices as evidence to support these claims. Our research was designed to operationalize and attempt to validate these claims. Can Army intelligence forces access and exploit big data in dense urban environments while operating under their current OSINT collection authorities? To characterize dense urban environments, we found that intelligence organizations needed access to transactional data (financial, social, transportation, and business transactions). We found that our Army OSINT authorities allow partial access to social transactions, with limited access to financial, transportation, and business transactions.","20160801BeskowIPB_for_Megacities_Environments.txt"

Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) research efforts focus on developing methodologies to perform systems engineering analysis in a model-based physics-driven environment. Terms used to describe a system’s overall attributes are collectively referred to as “ilities”, and include such terms as reliability, maintainability, sustainability, etc. Research has focused on correlating the ilities to aspects of resilience and establishing an ERS framework that links the relationships between the ilities. Such framework could be used to guide future ERS efforts to further define, develop, and quantify overall system resilience. This presentation explores the ilities of interest to the DoD with particular emphasis on military context, previous research and current practice, as well as efforts toward developing conceptual metrics and workflows to support ERS research.","20160801RinaudoIntegrating_the_-ilities-_into_the_Engineered_Resilient_Systems_(ERS)_framework.txt"

Realities of a budget constrained future with more capable threats require more sophisticated use of Army data systems, information technology and analytical methods to provide senior Army leaders with information that permits more efficient use of appropriated dollars. This brief will talk about how alignment of stove piped data across The Army Materiel Lifecycle process allows traceability of dollars across all product lines. How current acquisition programs align to capabilities needed by the Army and how capability gaps can be closed through targeted Science and Technology. An objective system could help manage seven appropriations containing over 20% of the Army budget with over $50B per year under Capital Investment. How we can link data to provide: 1) relative value scores for Army Required Capabilities (See ARCIC CNA) 2) linkages to current programmed and fielded materiel solutions (Acquisition Programs) 3) links system of systems materiel to allow for more control over capability set fielding 4) visibility over production schedules and dollar allocation across all product lines 5) ability to aggregate individual programs into resource portfolios, Army Warfighting Challenges, Capabilities, Capability Gaps or any other standard aggregation that can be mapped to individual pieces of equipment 6) facilitates divestiture and modernization path decisions 7) informs materiel readiness status of fielded units 8) informs what impacts are expected due to resource decisions at a State and local level 9) provides more efficient program and project management of programs 10) facilitates best practice and sharing of specialized programs Overall, the data system needs to leverage the strength of the Army Business Systems, create data linkages and link materiel solutions to more efficiently and effectively manage programs, manage portfolios and make resource informed value decisions based on Army Capital Investments.","20160812_Napier TRAC ARCIC Army Materiel Lifecycle Management from Data Perspective.txt"

GPS-guided artillery weapon delivery accuracy has always been estimated by computing a static set data binned into one or more firing conditions and based on a limited empirical data. This study looks at the feasibility of implementing Army GPS-guided weapons into the air-to-surface solution to GPS-guided weapon delivery accuracy, known as GWDAP. GWDAP predicts the delivery accuracy of GPS-guided weapons based on weapon terminal angle and satellite positions to provide a more robust delivery accuracy solution than a single CEP based on limited live fire test conditions. Multiple data sources, such as validated simulations or receiver specifications data sheets, can be used to calibrate the GWDAP inputs in order to improve the delivery accuracy characterization of GPS-guided weapon systems.","2016613ZollerAMSAA.Guided_Weapon_Delivery_Accuracy_Program(GWDAP).txt"
