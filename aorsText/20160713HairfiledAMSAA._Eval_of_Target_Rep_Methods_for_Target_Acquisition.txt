 Abstract:
Target presented area is used in combat simulations to support embedded direct fire and target
acquisition methodologies. Combat simulations need to compute target presented area for every
possible sensor - target pairing for each unique aspect and elevation 路angle. As such, a low cost,
rapid method of calculation is required. Currently, systems are represented using simple shapes
with accurate front and side presented areas and heights, and the intermediate areas are calculated
using basic geometric equations. This presentation will explore the error associated with these
methods for multiple system categories along with alternative methods of generating the data to
include variations on the box and ellipsoid methods as employed today, the introduction of new
simple shapes, and computer-aided design models.
