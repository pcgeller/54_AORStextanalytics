 Abstract:
“Readiness for ground combat is – and will remain – the U.S. Army’s #1 priority” stated Chief of Staff
of the Army, GEN Milley, in his 2015 Initial Message to the Army. The Army is moving away from
Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN), a readiness model that acted as an assembly line, providing
forces to a known and stable demand, towards a more flexible model in Sustainable Readiness
(SR). Facing an uncertain future threat, the Army needs to ensure a ready force that is responsive
to whichever crisis may arise. The initial focus of the SR process is on early deploying units, which
require a higher state of readiness and may therefore be required to be in the Active Component
(AC).
In support of the effort to improve the Army’s strategic readiness, the Center for Army Analysis
(CAA) has developed an algorithm designed to parse Time-Phased Force Deployment Data
(TPFDDs) associated with Operations Plans (OPLANs) created by the Combatant Commands to
determine daily unit requirements by type and highlight early deployer requirements across multiple
TPFDDs. Readiness and inventory must be managed not only for major combat units like Brigade
Combat Teams (BCTs), but also for hundreds of enabler units, eliciting the need for an automated
tool. CAA provides daily unit requirements to the SR process and to Total Army Analysis (TAA) to
inform unit readiness requirements and COMPO decisions. Defining and quantifying future threats
in terms of early deployer requirements will help the Army ensure it is ready to win the Nation’s
future wars.
