 Abstract:
Significant time and resources are spent on determining how we would fight in a given situation
against a specific enemy. A constraining factor that is often underestimated is how the forces got to
the fight. While the Atlantic and Pacific oceans have provided natural barriers to invading enemies
at home, they present a logistical problem that must be solved before we can deploy U.S. Military
forces into hostile areas of operations. When planning a campaign, it is important for the warfighter
to understand the impact Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS) operations would have on the
timing, type and quantity of forces commanders will have available in the early stages of operations.
Modeling the flow of various force packages through JLOTS operations clarifies a key factor that
would impact the planning of a successful operation.
In support of the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) campaign planning, the Deployment and Enablers
Division (DE) developed a quick flow analysis (QFA) simulation tool that explicitly models
intra-theater transportation. JLOTS operations use a constrained set of Army and Navy assets to
move cargo from an Intermediate Staging Base (ISB) to shore at austere or damaged ports or
beaches. By modeling the expected force flow, it can be determined when units would be available
to participate in the warfight. Modeling various force packages and flow priorities through these
operations provides the decision maker a better understanding of the impact intra-theater logistics
constraints have on the campaign when this is the only avenue for troop entry.
