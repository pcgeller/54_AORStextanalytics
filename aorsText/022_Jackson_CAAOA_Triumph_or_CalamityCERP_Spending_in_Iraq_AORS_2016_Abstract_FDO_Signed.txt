 Abstract:
The principle aim of most statistical analyses is to discover associations of explanatory variables
with the mean value of a response. In this talk, we discuss an approach to discovering associations
explanatory variables may have with the probability that the response will change. The purpose of
such a model is to characterize not only the value of the response variable, but also the likelihood
that the response will change to between states. We use operational data and Commander's
Emergency Relief Program (CERP) spending in Iraq as an example of where this type modeling
might be appropriate.
