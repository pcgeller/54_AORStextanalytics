 Abstract:
Gone are the days when widgets broke solely due to physical processes and root cause analysis
was a fairly straight-forward engineering activity. In the modern era of software-intensive and
software-only acquisition systems, widgets are made of software. Finding the root cause of a
malfunction requires an entirely different skill set -- and an entirely different approach to data
collection-- than has been previously required in test and evaluation.
In this presentation, we will explore the growing role of data science in test and evaluation,
particularly with respect to fault-tracing and root-cause analysis across multiple interfaces (hardware
and software, virtual and physical machines, servers and clients, seen and unseen processes, and
the like), the use of server and system logs as a data source, and test planning implications. These
will be accompanied by examples and lessons-learned from multiple system tests.
