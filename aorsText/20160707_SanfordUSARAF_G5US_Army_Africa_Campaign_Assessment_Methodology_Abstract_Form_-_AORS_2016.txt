 Abstract:
Under the original USARAF campaign assessment construct, the ORSA Branch was responsible not
only for developing the assessment framework, but also for conducting the assessment itself. This
presented several challenges. First, no other staff sections had responsibility for conducting
assessments; thus they lacked a proper understanding of the process and had little incentive to
contribute to it. Paradoxically, these same staff sections were responsible for planning USARAF’s
intermediate military objectives (IMOs)—the framework by which the ORSA Branch conducted its
assessments. Second, a lack of emphasis on assessments resulted in a shift from bi-annual to
annual updates, which failed to provide timely and actionable recommendations for the command to
impact and provide guidance on. Subsequently, the ORSA Branch found itself heavily engaged in
preparing the campaign assessment for three months of the year, with little to no time or resources
devoted to assessments for the other nine. Lastly, the assessment process lacked any automated
data collection or archival capability. This resulted in excessive time spent collecting and
synthesizing data and reviewing historical assessments to identify any correlation or trends.
In August 2015, the ORSA Branch spearheaded the development of a new campaign assessment
process to establish an effective, relevant, and repeatable assessment process that:
• Focused on the commander’s objectives and end-state.
• Identified and considered specific indicators in context with related factors and informed human
judgment.
• Ensured credibility by validation through a whole-of-staff approach.
• Presented findings clearly and concisely.
• Established context that linked evidence, arguments, and recommendations to the end state.
• Provided an implementable solution that did not impose unrealistic requirements on subordinate
elements.
• Scrutinized relevant evidence and logic using analytic rigor supported by professional military
judgement.
• Presented unbiased results without a predetermined outcome.
• Integrates the insights and expertise of all relevant staff sections and stakeholders.
The USARAF ORSA Branch developed a framework that now serves as the foundation for future
campaign assessments and plays a vital role in the planning and approval of all IMOs. Indicators of
progress—quantitative and qualitative data points that inform the assessment process—allow the
command to visualize conditions and effects and how they progress lines of effort toward specified
end states, and the “risk to mission” assessment highlights potential pitfalls which may adversely
impact the mission, allowing the command to proactively act, rather than react, to mitigate that risk.
Through the Strategic Management System, a web-based application and the Army’s program of
record for performance management, USARAF has institutionalized its data to provide auditable
records that allow for longitudinal analysis of historical trends.
