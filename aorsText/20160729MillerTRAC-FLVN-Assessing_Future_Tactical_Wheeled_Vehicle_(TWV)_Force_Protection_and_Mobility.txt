 Abstract:
During combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army operated in non-linear and contiguous
environments where all vehicles were targets for the enemy. Greater exposure to non-conventional
threats drove the need for increased force protection levels across the tactical wheeled vehicle
(TWV) fleet. Mobility levels decreased as a result of armoring the TWV fleet, reducing commanders’
flexibility to conduct missions both on-and off-road. As the Army makes decisions about how best to
operate in tomorrow’s conflicts, they must provide commanders with an appropriate balance
between force protection and mobility within its TWV fleet.
The US Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC) is leading a study to assess
current and required TWV force protection and mobility levels across the entire fleet. Brigade
combat teams, echelon above brigade units, and TRADOC centers of excellence provided
assessments on vehicle roles and capabilities in the context of changing conditions including
threats, terrain, and joint operational phases during operational workshops. The study team will
identify force protection and mobility imbalances by comparing operational units’ force protection
and mobility needs with the current fleet’s performance data. These results will inform senior Army
leaders and stakeholders to make decisions on future fleet requirements and strategies.
This presentation describes the study’s overall methodology with a focus on the operational
analysis.
