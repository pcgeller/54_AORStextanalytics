 Abstract:
The need to inform radar acquisition decisions early in the acquisition cycle is driving the
requirement for methodology to inform potential system capabilities and limitations. The power
aperture product (PAP) Figure of Merit (FOM) was used to assess potential tactical ballistic missile
(TBM) capability based on the preliminary radar hardware designs. The power aperture form of the
Radar Range Equation provides a way to assess the salient radar parameters given the requirement
to search for a target of certain radar cross section at a desired range over a solid angle volume in a
given amount of time. A required PAP was computed for a given search problem (search area,
required acquisition , and threat). The required PAP was then compared to the PAP of the radar
design to assess the TBM capability. The assessment varied a simple ballistic trajectory using
different initial velocities and angles to represent different classes of TBMs. The study assessed the
timeline to determine the firm track range and PAP needed to intercept at different altitudes for a
given interceptor. By categorizing the threat classes the study scoped potential capabilities of the
hardware designs to inform acquisition decisions early in the process.
