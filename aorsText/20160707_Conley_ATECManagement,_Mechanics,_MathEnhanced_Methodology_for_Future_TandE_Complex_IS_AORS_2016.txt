 Abstract:
Current test methods use analytical rigor “science” for integrated test and evaluation (T&E) of
complex information technology (IT) systems. These procedures typically minimize the importance
of the human-in-the-loop, limiting the art of the military-decision-making-process (MDMP). Normally,
integrated testing enhances the operational realism in developmental test (DT) environments while
the statistical confidence and power in an operational test (OT) is usually missing. Recognizing that
IT systems are growing in complexity, the Management, Mechanics, and Math (M3) methodology
and associated briefing format was devised as a way to think through and create testing that
enables a more effective analysis, including both science and art. This systematic methodology can
be used as a tool for conducting T&E of complicated information systems within the full range of
military operations to: collect, evaluate, and understand data regarding system and user
effectiveness through enhanced control of a chaotic operational environment, mimicking realistic
environments.
