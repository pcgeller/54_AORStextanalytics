 Abstract:
The Army’s Gator mine system is noncompliant with Department of Defense’s landmine policy and
will reach the end of its shelf life by 2025. The DMTTS&E AoA is considering new, policy-compliant
alternative solutions. As part of the DMTTS&E AoA, the study team developed new materiel
alternatives based on subject matter expert (SME) knowledge and directed guidance from the Office
of the Secretary of Defense.
This presentation will discuss the materiel alternative development process, including frequent
consultations with the SME community to generate a list of all possible alternative components: (1) a
screening process for reducing the number of alternative components and alternative candidates;
(2) the refinement of attributes for evaluating alternative candidates; (3) the development of data
collection tools and an analytic procedure to select final alternatives; and (4) a workshop to execute
the process by which the final alternatives were selected for further analysis within the AoA. As
analysts seek innovative solutions to address the military’s key problems under shortened timelines,
future analysis may rely more heavily on the integration of human knowledge and subjective
reasoning. This presentation will review the application of such analysis in the DMTTS&E materiel
alternative development process. The key take-aways are better understanding of the importance of
engaging the SME community and the value of workshops to leverage experience and information.
