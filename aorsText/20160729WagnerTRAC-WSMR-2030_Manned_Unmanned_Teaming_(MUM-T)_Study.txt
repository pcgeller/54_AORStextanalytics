 Abstract:
In support of the Department of the Army G-3/5/7 DAMO-Aviation, the United States (U.S.) Army
Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) led an Army Regulation 5-5
study on MUM-T. The study purpose was to identify the 2030 vision for MUM-T, determine desired
capabilities and attributes for MUM-T systems, and examine feasibility of desired capabilities and
attributes to meet the 2030 demand signal. Key aspects of the study included development and
staffing of a 2030 MUM-T vision, identification of desired capabilities and attributes, attribute
feasibility assessment, and a Threat and operational assessment. The exploratory nature of this
analysis combined with time and funding limitations led the study team to rely heavily on Warfighter
and technical subject matter expert input. Based on all information gathered, the analysis team
delivered a stakeholder-approved vision statement, a list of desired capabilities and attributes, and
near- and mid-term considerations for MUM-T capability development along with recommendations
on areas to focus future analysis efforts.
This presentation will discuss the study methodology including the measurement space workshop,
Warfighter workshops and surveys, feasibility assessment, and operational assessment.
