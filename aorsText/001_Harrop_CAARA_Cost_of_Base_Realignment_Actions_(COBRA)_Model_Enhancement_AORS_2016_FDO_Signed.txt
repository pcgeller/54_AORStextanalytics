 Abstract:
The Department of Defense (DoD) has used the Cost of Base Realignment Actions (COBRA) model
since the first Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round in 1988. COBRA is a cost comparison
model that allows an analyst to compare competing BRAC scenarios and up until now has not been
used outside of BRAC. However, the Military Departments could use COBRA to provide cost
comparisons for day-to-day stationing or strategic stationing decisions. COBRA has not been
updated since the 2005 BRAC round, when a DoD Joint Process Action Team (JPAT) rewrote
multiple algorithms to account for changes in technology and DoD business operations. To fully
understand the magnitude of strategic stationing decisions, the DoD needs to consider the costs and
savings associated with alternative stationing scenarios in a consistent manner. An enhanced
COBRA model with additional analytic capabilities will support such a need.
The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has initiated a new JPAT outside of BRAC to review
the COBRA modelâ€™s structure, analysis capabilities, and algorithms. The JPAT will update
algorithms due to technology and business practices as in the past, but is also looking to improve
the user experience and enhance its analytic capabilities to provide a more powerful decision
support system for the Departments. Once the model is updated, the Departments can use
COBRA in all stationing analyses to inform decisions outside of BRAC as well as prepare to support
any future BRAC. We will discuss the JPAT initiative and the planned analytic enhancements.
