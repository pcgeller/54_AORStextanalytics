 Abstract:
Department of Defense (DoD) systems are required to operate and rapidly respond to new and
changing conditions. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) research efforts focus on developing
methodologies to perform systems engineering analysis in a model-based physics-driven
environment. Terms used to describe a system’s overall attributes are collectively referred to as
“ilities”, and include such terms as reliability, maintainability, sustainability, etc. Research has
focused on correlating the ilities to aspects of resilience and establishing an ERS framework that
links the relationships between the ilities. Such framework could be used to guide future ERS efforts
to further define, develop, and quantify overall system resilience. This presentation explores the
ilities of interest to the DoD with particular emphasis on military context, previous research and
current practice, as well as efforts toward developing conceptual metrics and workflows to support
ERS research.
