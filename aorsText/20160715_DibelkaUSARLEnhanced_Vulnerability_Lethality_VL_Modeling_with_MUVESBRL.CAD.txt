 Abstract:
The MUVES and the Ballistic Research Laboratories Computer Aided Design (BRL-CAD) toolset are
the primary V/L models utilized in many Army Acquisition programs throughout the entire acquisition
life-cycle. This toolset has been the Army’s workhorse V/L model for 25 years and is constantly
being enhanced to handle new requirements imposed by new munition types, additional damage
mechanisms and improved vehicle designs.
The BRL-CAD is the primary CAD package for vehicle modeling in V/L analyses and has had
numerous capabilities recently added such as a universal geometry conversion utility and
component datum’s. In addition, a semi-automated process has been developed to support the
testing community in computing the striking presented area of an irregular fragment, a key
measurement for the validation of fragment penetration algorithms.
The MUVES has been recently enhanced in support of current and future acquisition programs with
capabilities such as: multi-hit armor performance, incorporation of the Modified-Langley V50
distribution characterization developed in the testing community, assessment of stacked ammo,
dynamic geometry, a polar grid technique or munition centric analyses, and an improved irregular
fragment characterization/penetration technique supported by Joint Live Fire validation testing. The
Army Research Laboratory’s Survivability/Lethality Analysis Directorate is also modernizing MUVES
by updating to standard C++ libraries, exploiting current computer chip sets with multi-threaded
analyses and vectorization, and a port to the Windows platform.
These enhanced vulnerability/lethality capabilities will be described along with a brief set of
upcoming features for MUVES/BRL-CAD.
