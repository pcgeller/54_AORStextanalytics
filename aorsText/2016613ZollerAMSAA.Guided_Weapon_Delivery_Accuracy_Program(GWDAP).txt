Abstract:
The Guided Weapon Delivery Accuracy Program (GWDAP) models GPS-guided delivery accuracy
based on a simple error budget that combines specific GPS constellation errors with weapon GPS
receiver and guidance and control errors to provide improved data characterization .
GPS-guided artillery weapon delivery accuracy has always been estimated by computing a static set
data binned into one or more firing conditions and based on a limited empirical data. This study
looks at the feasibility of implementing Army GPS-guided weapons into the air-to-surface solution to
GPS-guided weapon delivery accuracy, known as GWDAP. GWDAP predicts the delivery accuracy
of GPS-guided weapons based on weapon terminal angle and satellite positions to provide a more
robust delivery accuracy solution than a single CEP based on limited live fire test conditions.
Multiple data sources, such as validated simulations or receiver specifications data sheets, can be
used to calibrate the GWDAP inputs in order to improve the delivery accuracy characterization of
GPS-guided weapon systems.
