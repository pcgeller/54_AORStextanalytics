 Abstract:
A large number of Air and Missile Defense (AMD) analyses are conducted using computer
simulation software such as the Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM). These simulations
use scripted Red fire plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the Blue/Green AMD defenses. The
author has observed that in most studies, these scripted input fire plans are developed based on
subject matter expert opinion with little to no analytic rigor, even though the results of the simulations
are highly dependent on those fire plans. In addition, due to the complexity and runtime
requirements of the simulation, typically only a few variations of the laydown or tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) are tested.
In order to develop an analytically rigorous fire plan as well as a testing platform for different AMD
laydowns and TTPs, a new analytic framework is required. This study will outline a wargame
process to explore the relationship between Red fire plans, and Blue/Green AMD laydowns and
TTPs. The output from the wargame will be one or more red fire plan(s) and one or more AMD
laydowns that were developed in an analytically rigorous environment.
This wargame methodology will explain the setup and conduct of the wargame as well as the
adjudication process for the engagements. The surface-to-air engagement results are based on
predictive models from EADSIM simulation runs in order to ensure a high level of analytic rigor.
Additionally, damage effects calculations from leakers are based on AMSAA lethal area data and
weaponeering hit/miss calculations.
