 Abstract:
Physics of Failure (PoF) Design Risk Methodology
The Army is increasingly looking at ways to get ahead of the curve and develop future systems.
This requires more and more analyses, such as Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs) , to be conducted
early on in systems' lifecycles, sometimes while they are still just an abstract idea. Delivering
meaningful results early in the lifecycle can be challenging , but these analyses have the potential to
shape important decisions that can impact a system's cost, schedule, and performance for decades
to come . Reliability can be a key driver of a system's operating and sustainment costs which
commonly account for a majority of the costs over the life of the system. Assessing reliability and
failure risk early on in the lifecycle can ensure that the alternatives selected and developed deliver
the required reliability while keeping a system on schedule, at cost, and performing properly.
AMSAA has developed two methodologies to assess reliability early in the lifecycle. One, the
Reliability Scorecard , is focused on the vendor's practices, processes and procedures and has been
vetted by industry and used for years. The other methodology, which this paper will focus on, was
developed to evaluate the failure risk of a system based on an understanding of the system design
and intent, common failure modes, and Physics of Failure (PoF) practices. In-depth engineering
analyses are just not feasible at this stage of the lifecycle when a system has yet to be designed in
full , let alone tested . Instead , the methodology depends on analyzing the design's mechanical
subsystems, materials, technology, and operational environment to identify potential failure modes
and assess the risk of failure precipitating. This method provides a means to evaluate and analyze
a system's risk of failure. This knowledge can be used to make effective decisions early on in the
lifecycle to determine the direction a program should take and draw attention to any glaring
concerns. Addressing reliability early on in the lifecycle enables the program to develop corrective
actions and mitigate risk before failures are realized , saving the Army time and money and
delivering a better product to the warfighter.
