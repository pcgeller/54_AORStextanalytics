 Abstract:
4th Infantry Division (4ID) serves as the U.S. Army’s only balanced division, operating with each a
Light, Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Team formation. As military operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan continue to change from stability and wide area security to a lower demand train and
assist mission, the Army can refocus on offense and defense tasks. Staff sections throughout major
headquarters (HQ) are now returning to or relearning root doctrine. However, ORSAs do not have
the same foundation as fellow combat arms officers. ORSA’s are learning where we fit into the HQ’s
staff as well as how to best support current operations in both the garrison and tactical
environments. With a focus on the tactical environment while executing Decisive Action (DA)
operations the Division/Corps ORSAs provide critical information and assistance in the targeting
process. With input coming from the Assessments working (AWG) into the Targeting Working Group
(TWG) and assisting with the decisions being made in the Targeting Decision Board (TDB) ORSAs
have a unique opportunity to be a key piece to ensure mission success.
The targeting process focuses on a 72hr mission cycle with the model of Assess, Decide, Detect,
and Deliver. The ORSA team, with the support from the AWG, brings forward the base assessment
that begins this process. The Operational and Tactical Assessment provides the current situation of
operations as well as highlights the effectiveness of the last 24hrs of the targeting cycle. This directly
provides needed information into the Decide phase of the targeting process. Further, the ORSAs
understanding and knowledge of the Detect and Deliver phases ensures overall understanding and
maintains situational awareness of future operations and how they may impact future assessments.
This presentation highlights and reviews the Targeting Process with a focus on the Assessments
team support and input to that process.
