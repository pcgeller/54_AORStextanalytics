 Abstract:
The Logistics Battle Command (LBC) model, developed and used by the Training and Doctrine
Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center, is a discrete event simulation written in Java that uses the
Naval Postgraduate School's Simkit Application Programming Interface. LBC is currently used for
comparative assessments of force designs, weapon systems, vehicles or concepts of support with
respect to their impact on military logistics, but it is also being developed into a decision support tool
for planners and logisticians with a target roll-out date of 2018.
LBC provides some distinct modeling advantages by nesting transportation, communication, and
planning networks. It may run deterministically or apply probability distributions to obtain stochastic
results, making it ideally suited for use with experimental design. LBC accepts input from other tools
such as Force Generator (FORGE), Joint Integrated Contingency Model (JICM), Attrition Distribution
Tool (ADT), and Operations Logistics (OPLOG) Planner. This presentation will cover the recently
integrated Threat Impact Assessment capability, which allows LBC to account for attrition and loss
of supplies and supply distribution assets as a result of enemy actions against resupply operations.
