 Abstract:
Due to unique hiring requirements, USARAF has long struggled to meet the 120 day standard set
forth by OPM resulting in personnel gaps. In November 2015, the US Army Africa (USARAF)
Deputy Chief of Staff (DCOS) tasked the ORSA Branch to conduct a study of current USARAF
hiring actions completed in 2015 to determine trends, identify problem areas, and recommend
solutions to improve the current process. The study consisted of analysis of empirical evidence from
74 hiring actions coupled with a qualitative analysis of surveys completed by supervisors and
recently hired employees to identify process choke points and areas for increased efficiency. The
completed study was briefed to the DCOS, directorate leads and deputies, and supervisors. The
analysis sheds light on areas of improvement in the current USARAF process and implications of
unique requirements placed on USARAF hiring actions (i.e. overseas, passport requirements).
Results from the study are currently being used to reevaluate and streamline civilian hiring in
USARAF.
