 Abstract:
The number of active component enlisted soldiers separating from the Army due to a disability is
presently 2.5 times higher than pre-2005 rates, now accounting for one in every five enlisted losses.
Despite the hardships of almost 15 years of continuous conflict, increased operational deployments
cannot explain the magnitude or timing of the increase in disability loss. Two law changes including
Concurrent Retirement Disability Pay (part of NDAA 2003) and Combat Related Special
Compensation (part of NDAA 2008), substantially increased disability compensation and the
incentive to seek a disability separation. Additionally, average ratings assessed by the Department
of Veterans Affairs has steadily increased over this same time period further increasing disability
compensation. Consistently higher disability loss necessitate additional recruiting and training
requirements each year and drains valuable experience from the force. Despite the extremely
sensitive nature of veteranâ€™s benefits, military and civilian leadership should examine policies and
law changes that could reduce the cost of the now consistently higher disability loss.
