 Abstract:
The proliferation of sensors and machine data, both on battlefield and in garrison, require new and
innovative ways to analyze, visualize, and communicate results to decision makers. The next
generation of decision makers and staff will increasingly ask for “analytic tools” and interactive
dashboards rather than static analysis. Tableau, and other dashboarding software packages, allow
for the efficient production of such tools.
This presentation will provide practical applications of dashboards built to automate and enhance
analysis across multiple categories of data including survey data, operational data, simulation data,
and cyber data. Examples will range from replicating and automating routine PowerPoint slides, to
analyzing large sets of simulation data. This presentation will also demonstrate an enterprise level
dashboard deployment at the Gallup Organization that automated and enhanced World Poll data
vetting, significantly improving the depth of analysis and reducing resources required to process and
analyze the data.
