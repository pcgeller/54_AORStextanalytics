 Abstract:
The United States Army Transportation School developed the Master Driver Trainer Qualification
Course (MDTQC) in Fiscal Year 13 in an effort to reduce accident rates. The MDTQC covers
standard programs for operator safety, risk management, and accident avoidance. Course
graduates become a certified Master Driver Trainer (MDT) responsible for planning and
implementing their unit’s driver training programs. Through its graduates, the MDTQC aims to
reduce the frequency and severity of Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) accidents across Army
commands.
The Transportation School asked TRAC-LEE to identify a correlation between their course and the
TWV accident rate and thus determine if their strategy was working. TRAC-LEE leveraged a US
Army Combat Readiness Center database of vehicular accidents to consider the impact of MDTs on
US Army driver safety and TWV accidents. In addition, a survey of the MDTQC graduates was
conducted to gauge their influence on unit implementation, including effectiveness and training.
Using these lines of evidence, TRAC-LEE found a positive relationship between the implementation
of the MDTQC and a reduction in the frequency and severity of Army TWV accidents. A similar
relationship was found when classification, vehicle type, and geographical location were taken into
account. This presentation will discuss the analysis and findings of TWV accidents before and after
the inception of the MDTQC.
