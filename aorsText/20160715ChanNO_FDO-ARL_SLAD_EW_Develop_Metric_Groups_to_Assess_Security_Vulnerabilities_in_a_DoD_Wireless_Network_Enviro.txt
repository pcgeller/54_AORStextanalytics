 Abstract:
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a form of Near-field communication (NFC) is changing the
Cybersecurity landscape. Our dependence on interconnected technology is overwhelming our ability
to protect it. Part of security vulnerabilities of DoD NFC type of wireless network systems are
inherited from the common security vulnerabilities of wireless network itself. Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) systems are important resources where field data and big data are generated. We should give
an extra breadth of considerations in assessing security vulnerabilities to support applications
involving NFC/BLE systems. In order to pro-actively mitigating the common vulnerabilities of a DoD
wireless network based NFC/BLE systems, a new security vulnerability assessment framework with
additional metric groups are implemented. Through experiments, it can be demonstrated that the
new approach is capable of effectively assessing security vulnerabilities common to wireless
network based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) systems.
