Abstract:
The U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) evaluated sensor and mine field
concepts that could serve as effective alternatives to current mine systems for the DMTTS&E AoA
by utilizing the Fusion Oriented C41SR Utility Simulation (FOCUS). FOCUS was used to develop
sensor field-level performance data that can be leveraged by Mission-level and Campaign-level
combat simulations. The content of this briefing centers on the development of the performance data
generated by FOCUS for the alternative sensor/mine fields and the assessment of their performance
for the AoA. The methodology synthesizes multiple sensor types and nodes into sensor fields that
can be represented as a probability of acquisition from a specified geographic location. The end
product generated by the FOCUS model is performance data at the individual sensor, node , and
field level that can be easily and rapidly incorporated into combat simulations of varying levels of
fidelity.
