 Abstract:
The Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) and Uniform Integrated
Protection Ensemble Increment II (UIPE II) will provide individual protection from chemical and
biological agents, radioactive material, and other battlefield contaminants.
Based upon utilization rates and forecasted lot expirations, current inventory levels and projected
procurements, it is imperative that the Army establish a holistic capital investment strategy to sustain
the long-term modernization objectives and viability of chemical and biological personal protective
capabilities to meet Army and joint operational requirements while ensuring life-cycle affordability.
This quantitative analysis will underpin and inform development of a sound Army investment plan
that identifies and adequately considers risk by maintaining sufficient inventory levels of JSLIST and
UIPE II, meeting the full range of operational and joint requirements; modernizing the Total Joint
Force; and maintaining equipment fills and readiness of chemical-biological ensembles in the most
cost effective manner possible.
