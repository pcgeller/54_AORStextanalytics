 Abstract:
When looking at munitions requirements in the aggregate, a campaign can be simplified into two
questions, “Who shot at what?” and “What did it kill?” CAA has consistently been asked to
determine the munitions shot distribution and kills of targets for the Army’s share of various theater
campaign phased threat distributions (PTD). In response to this ongoing requirement, CAA
developed a repeatable and adaptable methodology using prior modeled output modified to address
alternative assumptions of target density and munitions availability.
As a process improvement, a repeatable and adaptable tool using this methodology is being
developed which provides the decision maker flexibility in assumptions and inputs while calculating
a reasonable shot distribution and projected kills. The tool has two inputs: the quantity of munitions
by type and the quantity of targets by type which can be varied by the decision maker. To calculate
the shot distribution of munitions to targets, two preferred realities are considered: 1) Given a
quantity of munitions what is the preferred shot to target, and 2) Given a quantity of targets what is
the preferred munitions required to address them. These ratios and the expected red system kills
are currently being calculated using modeled output from a representative scenario, but this tool is
designed to be modified based on SME input. By comparing what you would prefer to shoot your
munitions at, with how you would prefer to kill a target, it’s possible to create a munitions-to-target
shot distribution constrained by munitions availability and target density.
