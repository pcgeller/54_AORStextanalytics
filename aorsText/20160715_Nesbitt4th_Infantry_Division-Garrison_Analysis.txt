 Abstract:
4th Infantry Division (4ID) serves as the U.S. Army’s only balanced division, operating with each a
Light, Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Team formation. As military operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan continue to change from stability and wide area security to a lower demand train and
assist mission, the Army can refocus on offense and defense tasks. Staff sections throughout major
headquarters (HQ) are now returning to, or relearning root doctrine. However, ORSAs do not have
the same foundation as fellow combat arms officers. ORSA’s are learning where we fit into the HQ’s
staff as well as how to best support current operations in both the garrison and tactical
environments. With a focus on the garrison environment, the division ORSA is valuable to the
commander by both leveraging an analytical approach for objective mission analysis, and
communicating the results and insights to inform decision making.
Garrison operations for 4ID ORSAs fall into three categories: command directed studies, Fort
Carson health promotion, and analysis supporting staff. Command directed studies includes directed
analysis, assessment, or review in support of division command team priorities. Fort Carson health
promotion includes coordinating actions and developing collaborative analysis products to support
the Community Health Promotion Council. This could include performing as a staff lead for
developing programs to support the Installation Prevention Team. Finally, the ORSA integrates with
key staff sections to apply problem solving skills, including research design and methodology
development. ORSAs serve to provide analytical horsepower to overcome obstacles to the division
mission.
