 Abstract:
Improved representation of the urban fight with combat models is an increasingly critical requirement
for the United States Army. An important depiction of urban operations involves the use of behaviors
in the simulation of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) to execute room and building clearing
tasks. Movement to buildings with the Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century
(COMBATXXI) model is performed through the Coordinated Maneuver Methodology Tool (CMMT).
To simplify scenario developments and improve simulations of these TTPs, the United States Army
Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) is adding to COMBATXXI and
CMMT behaviors that dynamically execute and manage operations for clearing rooms and buildings.
A follow-on effort will apply Hierarchical Task Networks in support of decision-making techniques
linking CMMT and generic urban operations behaviors. This presentation will describe the modeling
approaches to execute room and building clearing operations
