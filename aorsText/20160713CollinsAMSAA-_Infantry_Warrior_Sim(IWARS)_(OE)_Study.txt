ABSTRACT The TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC), AMSAA, and the Center for Army Analysis
(CAA) formed an OE Analysis Task Force (OEATF) to develop an analytical methodology to directly
address OE-related issues to include conducting Army OE analyses. A combat simulation
possessing the capability to adequately portray the operational effects of energy loss was examined
using the IWARS simulation.
The IWARS simulation was used to represent energy maintenance and usage for each individual
agent within a scenario. To understand the implications of energy depletion, AMSAA compared the
following two basic metrics: Percent of the total agents that ran out of energy and the time after
scenario start in which every agent encountered total energy depletion. In addition an attempt was
made to simulate longer scenarios.
 IWARS was modified to collect individual and squad energy usage for various Soldier systems, such
as sensors and radios , while conducting operational missions. Three operational scenarios were
developed in collaboration with Maneuver Center of Excellence and used by IWARS to obtain study
results. The methodology and results of the three scenarios are discussed in this presentation.
