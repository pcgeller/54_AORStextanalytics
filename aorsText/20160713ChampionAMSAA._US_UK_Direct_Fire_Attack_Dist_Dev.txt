 Abstract:
AMSAA and the United Kingdom's Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) are jointly
developing direct fire attack distributions (DFADs) to be utilized in combat and combat support
vehicle survivability assessments. The
AMSAA/DSTL DFAD work is part of an Integrated Survivability Project, which
is executed under an Information Exchange Agreement. The intended output of the DFAD effort is a
set of attack distributions that could be utilized in threat lethality assessments, vehicle survivability
and force protection assessments, operational effectiveness assessments, etc. which in turn support
Army acquisition decisions. AMSAA's Survivability Team co-manages and executes the DFAD task
under an Information Exchange Agreement.
The current U.S. Army standard attack distribution, the Combat Vehicle-Combat Performance
Operational Assessment (CV-CPOA), was developed in the late 1980's and has several limitations
including the absence of attack distributions for modern day irregular warfare. Similarly, DSTL has
utilized the Whittaker Distributions, which were derived from land attacks in World War II. Given that
today's conflicts do not resemble the open land warfare of past conflicts and the threat attack
characteristics are markedly different (asymmetric, irregular, etc.), it make sense to develop attack
distributions to reflect the variety of conflicts experienced today.
As a result, AMSAA is working with DSTL to analyze various attack information from current
conflicts as well as live/virtual/constructive combat simulation from U.S. and UK training developers,
with the intent to develop entirely new attack distributions for both conventional (combined arms
maneuver) and irregular (wide area security, etc.) operations.
