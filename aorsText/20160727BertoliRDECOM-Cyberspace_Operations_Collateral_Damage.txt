 Abstract:
Practically all military actions have the potential to result in undesirable collateral damage. The
military is bound by law to minimize any casualties to civilians and civilian objects, and has
developed clear procedures and tools to help predict the collateral damage that may result from the
employment of specific weapon systems under various conditions. These processes have been
refined over time, and are now very effective for the planning of kinetic operations. The emergence
of cyberspace as an operational domain is, however, adding new complexities. Evaluating the
overall effects of a cyberspace weapon is less intuitive and more multifaceted to predict.
Cyberspace capabilities have inherent differences in their behavior and employment that require
additional study and scrutiny. These complexities, however, have been misconstrued and
mythicized to the point where the perceived damage that can result from the employment of any
cyberspace tool is often greatly exaggerated. Much like a biological agent is categorized based on
its potential to affect a large portion of the global population, malicious software can be categorized
based on its propensity to indiscriminately affect a broad range of cyberspace systems based on six
attributes, namely: damage, controllability, detectably, remediation, exclusivity, and propagation.
Furthermore, when decomposed, as part of a holistic collateral damage taxonomy, the processes for
quantifying the undesirable effects that may result from the employment of many types of
cyberspace weapons is not that much different than from their kinetic counterparts.
