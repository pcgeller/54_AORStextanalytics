 Abstract:
In modeling the effectiveness of personal protection systems (body armor and vests) against the
threat of fragmenting munitions, the shape of the incoming fragments plays an important role . Both
older models (such as General Full Spray and CASRED) and newer ones (such as ICEM and
JMAE) have assumed that all fragments from a given munition have the same shape. Meanwhile,
measurements and studies at the Army Research Laboratory and Natick Soldier Center have shown
that such fragment shape factors follow a distribution : sometimes normal, sometimes log-normal,
sometimes other. AMSAA modified the CASRED and ICEM models to accept distributions from
these studies, plus distributions supplied by the Aberdeen Test Center. Comparing variable shape
factor model results with those using a fixed shape factor, AMSAA found that although there is some
difference in probability of incapacitation versus range averaged over all azimuth angles from the
burst, there are angles at which using a fixed shape factor can lead to significant overconfidence in
the effectiveness of an armor system in protecting the soldier against fragments.
