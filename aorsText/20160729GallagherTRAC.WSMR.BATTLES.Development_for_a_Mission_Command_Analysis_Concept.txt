 Abstract:
BATTLES, a quick-turn force-on-force model is in development by the United States Army Training
and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) to support a conceptual framework for
Mission Command analysis. The analysis framework is based on the operations process and is
designed to inform warfighter planning decisions by measuring operational outcomes of Friendly
courses of action against possible Threat courses of action; e.g., most likely and most dangerous.
Initial planning is done through an abbreviated military decision-making process, followed by
employment of the force-on-force model to represent and support follow-on phases of the operations
process which include prepare, execute, and assess phases. The desired result is an approach and
tool to inform complex decision-making for relevant scenarios.
This presentation will describe the development and components of BATTLES, explain how entity
behaviors are modeled, and discuss the modeling framework.
