 Abstract:
The US Army Military Police School requested a study to compare the performance of three
alternative vehicle platforms in a variety of typical Military Police (MP) missions. The Maneuver
Support Battle Lab created a constructive simulation environment in OneSAF to perform multiple
runs, control variables, and generate sufficient data. This presentation will focus on the use of
constructive simulation for analysis.
Various vignettes of Route Reconnaissance and Checkpoint Operation missions were developed in
OneSAF to examine the impact on overall operational effectiveness of the differences in Risk and
Performance by platform and configuration. Measures of merit focused on how well the alternative
platforms performed with respect to Survivability, Protection and Lethality. The constructive
simulation data provided statistically relevant results that will arm the MP School with information
about each platformâ€™s capabilities to determine which will best support the future MP force.
