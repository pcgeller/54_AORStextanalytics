 Abstract:
The US Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization was requested by the Kosovo
Security Forces (KSF) to support their annual Army training exercise (Eagle V). The Eagle training
exercises test the KSF’s ability to protect and support their country from internal issues. Eagle V
took place in October 2016 and looked at Kosovo’s ability to handle a significant amount of refugees
fleeing from Syria.
The cost analysis for a training exercise of this magnitude was unique for the KSF. Sparse planning
assumptions, size, lack of familiarity, and language barriers magnified and complicated the usual
ranges of risk and uncertainty associated with cost estimation. This paper will describe how a
United States Army Operations Research and Systems Analysis Officer developed cost estimation
tools for the KSF, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partner, to assist Kosovo’s military
growth.
