 Abstract:
The Army is looking to increase efficiencies wherever possible in order to become a leaner force of
the future. Many of the Army’s Science and Technology (S&T) initiatives are working towards efforts
that can optimize logistics, including alternative fuels and power generation, autonomous systems,
micro/smart grids, high energy lasers, alternative sources of water, and additive manufacturing. In
order to assess which efforts can provide the best efficiencies, Logistics Innovation Agency (LIA)
asked TRAC to conduct analysis to identify where and to what degree these S&T initiatives can
generate savings. Many of the efforts are in a premature state of development, requiring certain
assumptions to provide quantitative data. The study team used Tableau software to create a
dashboard incorporating the Operational Logistics (OPLOG) Planner database to build units and
scenarios. This presentation will address the study plan and methodology, while also providing
some insights into incorporating new tools with existing platforms and overcoming challenges.
