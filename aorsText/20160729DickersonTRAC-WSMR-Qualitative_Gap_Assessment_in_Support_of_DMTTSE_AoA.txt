 Abstract:
The Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD CAPE),
initiated the DMTTS&E AoA in 2015. The intent for the AoA is to develop and assess a range of
terrain shaping and area denial alternatives for the Joint Force that meet new operational and
landmine policy requirements, specifically intended for use in deep countermobility operations. The
United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) was
directed to identify the operational benefit provided by the Gator mine system, assess the capability
gap created by the loss of the Gator mine system, and examine the ability of potential nonmateriel
options, such as existing and programmed Joint systems, to mitigate any gap created by the loss of
the Gator mine system.
There are six deep terrain shaping missions that rely on the use of the current Gator mine system
which serve as the primary lens used to examine operational impacts and risks associated with the
loss of Gator mine system. TRAC employed a qualitative-based gap assessment approach given
constrained timelines and the requirement to deliver results early in the AoA. The approach relies on
military subject matter expert elicitation to develop risk matrices to assess the gap(s). Analyzing this
type of categorical data can prove challenging and the approach builds on the traditional composite
risk technique.
This presentation will discuss the methodology used in the study along with a review of the
limitations, assumptions, various challenges, and lessons learned from the gap assessment portion
of the AoA.
