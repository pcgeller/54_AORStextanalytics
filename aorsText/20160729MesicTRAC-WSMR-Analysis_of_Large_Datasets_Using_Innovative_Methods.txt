 Abstract:
Large complex datasets are a hallmark of the modern world. The ability to extract valuable
information from these large datasets is critical to leveraging their utility. Due to the often complex
nature of these datasets, new and innovative methods have been developed over the past 20 years
to aid both analyst and decision maker in using these new resources.
This presentation will provide a brief survey of some of these methods, including decision trees,
random forests, support vector machines, and hidden Markov models. Additionally, the presentation
will provide a review of Thomas Chadefaux’s paper and supporting analysis, “Early Warning Signals
for War in the News,” and a TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) effort building upon his work and
applying a hidden Markov model to his data for comparative analysis.
