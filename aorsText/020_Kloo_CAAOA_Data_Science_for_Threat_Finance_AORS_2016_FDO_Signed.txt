 Abstract:
This presentation describes how data science methods can be used to identify critical vulnerabilities
in threat networks. Specifically, we describe a scientific method for processing bulk financial
transaction records to develop meaningful (graph) representations of threat finance networks.
Analyzing these network representations facilitates the identification of critical vulnerabilities within
them, such as financial institutions supporting multiple criminal/terrorist networks.
