 Abstract:
The Whole Systems Trade Analysis Tool (WSTAT) pairs several separate subsystem model outputs
into a larger mapping structure to aid in stakeholder decisions. WSTAT takes many factors of the
subsystems into consideration and generates multiple alternatives for performance and cost trades
analysis. However, this tool is very resource demanding in terms of upfront workload. AMSAA
Mobility Team was tasked with generating several thousand outputs for cross-country mobility using
the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM) in a very short, unmanageable timeframe under
normal processing circumstances.
AMSAA Mobility Team developed the System Level Analysis Mobility Dashboard (SLAMD) which
simplifies data modeling and streamlines the simulation and reporting process for mobility analysis.
In order to provide support for WSTAT, an optimization module was developed within SLAMD to
complete the modeling runs. SLAMD allowed AMSAA Mobility to successfully deliver the analysis
results on time, which would have otherwise been impossible.
