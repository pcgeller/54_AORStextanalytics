 Abstract:
As communities report significant decreases in Veteran homelessness from 2010â€“2015, efforts have
turned from reactive care and rehabilitation to prevention. With significant populations of
contemporary Veterans transitioning to civilian life, there is an opportunity to adapt integration
processes to preclude the risk of homelessness. Significant data is collected from Soldiers and
Veterans at the point of military transition and intake to Veterans Administration (VA) care. This data
can inform caregivers of the risk for multiple undesirable outcomes of military transition, including
incidences of homelessness. With effective decision support tools based on this data, transition
commanders and clinicians can better prioritize care, and possibly preempt incidences of
homelessness. This project curates priority intelligence requirements aimed at identifying Veterans
of recent global contingency operations who are at risk of experiencing incidences of homelessness
after ending service in the United States Army. Having developed effective PIR, this project delivers
an immediate decision support tool for commanders, transition supervisors, and VA intake providers,
as well as the framework to automate that information collection and risk analysis in the future.
Roughly 900,000 Veterans of service to Iraq and Afghanistan will transition home in this decade.
This research supports efforts to enable successful transitions for high-risk Veterans, by effectively
directing targeted care.
