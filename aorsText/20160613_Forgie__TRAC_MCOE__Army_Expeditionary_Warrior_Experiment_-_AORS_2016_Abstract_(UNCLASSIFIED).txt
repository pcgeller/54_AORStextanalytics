 Abstract:
The Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE) is
the Armyâ€™s live, prototype experiment campaign focused on the Soldier and small unit. AEWE
supports the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) process with early
prototype analysis. It is complimentary to other events in the campaign of learning and supports
Force 2025 Maneuver objectives. AEWE 2016 was supported by ARCIC, all TRADOC Centers of
Excellence, the Army Test and Evaluation Command, the Research, Development, and Engineering
Command, the Army Material Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), the Army Research Institute, and
the Joint Deployable Analysis Team.
The Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) hosted AEWE from October 2015-February 2016.
Forty-five technologies, nominated by both government and industry partners, were assessed during
AEWE 2016. TRADOC Centers of Excellence collaborated to develop five experiment objectives.
The objectives are linked to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWfC) and included the following five
functional areas: situational understanding, small unit sustainment, mission command, lethality, and
protection and mobility.
The Maneuver Battle Lab led the analysis team that included members from. Army Materiel Systems
Analysis Activity (AMSAA), Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE), Cyber Center of Excellence
(CCoE) and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from the MCoE. The analysis team decomposed the
five experiment objectives into Essential Elements of Analysis (EEAs), Measures of Performance
(MoPs), and Measures of Effectiveness (MoEs). This process identified data requirements and
served as the basis for both data collection and analysis. During the experiment, the analysis team
collected data through various methodologies to include observations from SMEs, surveys, After
Action Reviews, focused interviews and group interviews.
Results of AEWE 2016 have broad impact across TRADOC, Army Materiel Command, and
ultimately the operational force. The recently completed AEWE 2016 informed six Capability
Development Documents (CDD), five Capability Production Documents (CPD), and one Capability
Based Assessment (CBA). Findings will inform candidate selections for three programs of record.
Three assessed capabilities are being transitioned for immediate availability to the force and three
other technologies will be further assessed during the 2018 Army Warfighting Assessment (AWA).
