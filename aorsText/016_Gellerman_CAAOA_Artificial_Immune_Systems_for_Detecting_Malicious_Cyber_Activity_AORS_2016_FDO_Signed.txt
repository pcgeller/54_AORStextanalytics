 Abstract:
Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the natural,
biological processes in vertebrate immune systems. These algorithms were first implemented in the
mid-1980s and have undergone continuous development since their initial formulation. This project
is a novel implementation of an AIS system written in Python and PostgreSQL and based upon the
work of Hofmeyr and Forrest. It was completed as the capstone project for the Georgetown Data
Science Graduate Certificate program.
A training set of data was selected and the model created using a negative selection algorithm that
is analogous to an immune systems T-cell and B-cell development process and antibody creation.
Non-trained data was then ingested by the model to simulate the continued operation of the
network. Trained detectors would trigger a response which would then alert an analyst of anomalies
and potentially malicious activity taking place on the network.
The algorithm is trained and tested on data provided by the Los Alamos National Labs Cyber
Security Research Center. This data consists of 58 consecutive days of de-identified event data
collected from five sources within Los Alamos National Laboratory's corporate, internal computer
network. The data used includes network authentication logs, processes started by Windows-based
desktops and servers, network flow data, domain name server logs, and known red team activities
on the network. The uncompressed data-set consists of over 120 GB of data and 1.5 billion rows of
records.
This presentation will discuss how the large data set was handled, processed, and modeled.
Performance results for the model and initial training sets may also be discussed.
