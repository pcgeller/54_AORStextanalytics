 Abstract:
        As part of the Total Army Analysis (TAA) process, G-37/FM Organizational Integrators (OIs)
have a challenging requirement to understand how changes in Army unit inventories affect the
Army’s ability to meet demand requirements. Tool for Assessing Demands Met Under Different
Inventories (TADMUDI) is a tool under development at the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) designed
to support these TAA force structure shaping decisions. Intended for use by the Army G-37/FM OIs,
this tool will enable rapid assessment of demands met through adjustments to the Army inventory.
Based on sponsor requests for simplicity, the initial version of this tool will leverage Excel to enable
static assessment of demands met by Standardized Requirements Code (SRC) based on
sponsor-directed Boots on the Ground (BOG) to dwell ratios. This simple approach represents a
significant move towards improved OI understanding of the implications of changes to planned
inventories to meet demands that are articulated by OSD-approved scenarios and vignettes;
however, static assessments significantly understate the complexity of operational force
employment. As an alternative methodology, CAA plans to extend the provided tool, leveraging the
results of dynamic analysis that accounts for the impacts of Relief in Place-Transfer of Authority
(RIP-TOA) between units and a demand signal which varies over time. Once both methodologies
are developed, CAA will compare the static and dynamic results to provide a more robust analytic
underpinning to Army force shaping decisions.
