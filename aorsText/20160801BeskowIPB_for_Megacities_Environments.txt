 Abstract:
The 2014 Chief of Staff of the Army Strategic Studies Group stated that “Analytical portfolios in the
DoD Intelligence Community are not focused on cities. Efforts focus on countries, regions,
adversaries and a variety of trends of concern to decision makers. While efforts are underway to
develop collection capabilities focused on remotely characterizing cities, there does not exist…any
analytical arm dedicated to understanding cities to support the war fighter.” Follow on research
efforts identified “big data” as the cornerstone of intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) in
dense urban environments. To support these claims, most research efforts point to the use of big
data by industry and local governments, along with the explosion of mobile devices as evidence to
support these claims. Our research was designed to operationalize and attempt to validate these
claims. Can Army intelligence forces access and exploit big data in dense urban environments
while operating under their current OSINT collection authorities? To characterize dense urban
environments, we found that intelligence organizations needed access to transactional data
(financial, social, transportation, and business transactions). We found that our Army OSINT
authorities allow partial access to social transactions, with limited access to financial, transportation,
and business transactions.
