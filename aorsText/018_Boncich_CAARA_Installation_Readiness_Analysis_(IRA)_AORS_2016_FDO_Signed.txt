 Abstract:
With the Chief of Staff of the Armyâ€™s top priority of readiness, installation managers are eager to
stress the link between services provided on installations and unit readiness. We can illuminate the
impact of installation services on readiness by careful examination of the historic prioritization of
funding for installations and potentially highlight critical HQDA validated requirements related to
installation services that may be underfunded.
The Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy & Environment
(DASA-IE&E) has expressed a commitment to ensure that installations provide the best services
possible to support unit readiness. An analytical overview of the direct and indirect linkages between
installation and service programs to unit readiness will help show the potential impact of funding
below requirements levels.
Analytical efforts include: Determining installation and service program linkages to unit readiness;
develop a proposed prioritization matrix to help articulate the direct and indirect support to unit
readiness; analysis of the Installation Program Evaluation Group (II PEG) service funding;
comparison of funding levels to requirements in the past and the future to assess short- and
long-term impact of deferred funding on Army readiness.
