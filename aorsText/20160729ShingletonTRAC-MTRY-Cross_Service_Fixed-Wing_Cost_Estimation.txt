 Abstract:
The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC), in the conduct
of analyses of alternatives (AoA) to assess materiel acquisition, requires the ability to compute
alternative capabilities’ operational costs to meet mission demands. These considerations are not
limited to Army-proposed capabilities, but often include Joint capabilities as well, complicating the
comparison of the costs to employ materiel solutions.
This challenge is especially acute when assessing costs of munitions delivered from platforms
operated by one of the Army's sister services – strict comparisons of life cycle costs are inadequate.
The analytic community and senior decision makers desire a method to compare costs to conduct
an attack of a given target with alternative means that include aerial (rotary wing, fixed wing) or
surface (ship, ground launcher) platforms. This presentation will focus on methodologies used by the
Air Force and Navy to develop fixed wing operating and support cost estimates and how they may
be used to develop mission costs that are equitable for all systems considered in an analysis.
