Abstract:
To improve ground vehicle mobility analyses and inform mission planning for combat operations,
AMSAA is developing novel geospatial analysis methodologies to build new NRMM terrains which
reflect operational conditions in areas of strategic interest to the DoD. NRMM has been used by the
U.S. Army and NATO for over 40 years to predict ground vehicle mobility performance. During this
time , NRMM has been modified to meet evolutionary modeling and simulation demands; however,
most of the terrain characterization has not been updated since the mid-late 1970s. As a result, the
existing terrain data does not represent key scenarios defined by the Support to Strategic Analysis
(SSA) process in the FY17-21 Defense Planning Guidance. AMSAA worked with members of the
Joint community to build a new playbox scenario terrain in an Area of Interest (AOI) that is
synchronized across the Joint combat simulation community. The methodology allows AMSAA to
leverage high resolution satellite imagery and remotely-sensed Geographic Information System
(GIS) data to better inform the Joint acquisition enterprise. The new NRMM terrains will help
decision makers understand ground mobility performance (and the impact on combat operations)
across a range of alternatives in a terrain that represents the platform's intended operational
environment. Additionally, by synchronizing the NRMM terrain generation process with Joint
Scenario AOI locations, new synergies will be created enabling combat modelers to reflect
system-level capabilities and limitations in force-on-force combat simulations environments; thereby,
generating new insights into operational system performance.
