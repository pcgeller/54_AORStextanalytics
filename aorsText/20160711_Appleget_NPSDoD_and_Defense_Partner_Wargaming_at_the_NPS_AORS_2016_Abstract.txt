 Abstract:
The Naval Postgraduate School has been teaching wargaming for over three decades. The 11-week
resident course has student-led wargaming teams develop wargames for sponsors from DoD and
other defense partners, including international sponsors. NPS also teaches a 5-day wargaming
course that is delivered at a sponsor's home station. This course has been taught at the Canadian
Forces Aerospace Warfare Center in Trenton,Ontario, at the Indonesian Naval Technical School in
Surabaya, Indonesia, at the Defence Science and Technology Group in Adelaide, Australia as well
as at STRATCOM, CENTCOM, and at Quantico for the U.S. Marine Corps. This presentation will
focus on the role of the sponsor in the resident course and will outline the learning objectives of
each course.
