 Abstract:
This presentation demonstrates an online decision aid for analysts to explore and select multiple
attribute decision making methods. The decision aid resulted from a literature review that
categorized methods based upon their data and software requirements, mathematical operations,
level of effort, and historical cases of use. The authors identified that no single resource existed for a
student or analyst to either explore methods interactively or match a method to their problem. This
presentation should be of interest to analysts and managers that use multiple attribute decision
making, which permeates analytical areas such as acquisitions, budgeting, and military planning.
