 Abstract:
Modern adversaries can now integrate cyber operations into military plans. Recent events have
shown that rival governments cannot only develop cyber-attack plans and implement them, but
synch them to achieve national goals. The U.S. Department of Defense must begin integrating and
normalizing the use of cyber effects. While there are numerous methods to begin the process, the
key is choosing one, and beginning the long process of its implementation training. The level at
which this training should be principally performed is at the U.S. Army Division level. Often, the
division is the first major headquarters that can develop a list of requirements to submit to a Joint
Task Force Headquarters or a Combatant Command. With that in mind, training the selected
method at home station and during Operational level exercises is absolutely necessary. Simulation
technology will catch up with cyber operations in due course, but this is no reason to not begin
training now.
