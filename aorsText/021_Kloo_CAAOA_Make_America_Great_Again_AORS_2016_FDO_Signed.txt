 Abstract:
Tracking the ways that ideas propagate through traditional media sources is potentially useful for
intelligence and information operations. This session will present a language-agnostic methodology
to capture, analyze, and visualize media narratives as they spread across multiple sources using the
popular slogan from Donald Trump’s campaign, “Make America Great Again,” as an example. The
proposed methodology leverages distributed computing (using Amazon Web Services), web
scraping techniques, language processing, and web-based visualization. The presentation will
include a demonstration of a web app (written in R) that implements the methodology.
