 Abstract:
The Complex Operating Environment Model (COEM) is a generic network of interdependent and
interacting social science and data validated relationship models that describe the political, military,
economic, social, information, infrastructure (PMESII) operational variables of a country or region.
COEM’s deterministic simulation is designed for investigating human, social, cultural, and behavioral
impacts resulting from changes in the environment. COEM can also be used as a simulation
environment to integrate with models representing specific mission sets or capabilities within a
complex operating environment.
The model may be populated with data specific to a country or regional area of interest. The
resulting interdependent and interoperable models provide decision makers with a deterministic
outcome of the PMESII effects for military missions in a complex environment.
This presentation will discuss TRAC’s approach to developing this capability as well as how this
capability has been applied to support an inquiry into the effects of a proposed concept on a region’s
PMESII environment.
