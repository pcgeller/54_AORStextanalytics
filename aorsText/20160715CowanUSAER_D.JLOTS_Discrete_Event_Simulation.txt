 Abstract:
The U.S. Army and Navy coordinate cargo entry into anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) points in lieu
of port infrastructure or as a supplement to insufficient port facilities. To meet throughput
requirements, planners and logisticians need insight into system behaviors that are driven by
diverse elements such as ship interarrival frequencies, availability of unloader resources, and
physical characteristics of beach, lighterage, and causeway construction. The interaction of these
variables create uncertainties due to system nonlinearities. This paper will address the components
comprising a JLOTS facility, how the entities interact under challenging environmental conditions,
and the logical processing of the behavioral interaction by discrete event simulation. A set of
scenarios will range over known driving parameters and the system sensitivities will be teased out
using visualization and standard statistical techniques.
