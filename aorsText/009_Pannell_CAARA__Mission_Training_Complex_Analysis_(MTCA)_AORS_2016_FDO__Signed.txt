 Abstract:
Mission Training Complexes (MTC) provide the capability to sustain Soldier individual digital skills,
unit Mission Command (MC) collective training, and warfighting functional competencies using
live-virtual-constructive gaming enablers. The efficient use of these facilities to integrate live and
simulation-based training will assist the Army in maintaining its desired level of readiness under the
shadow of diminishing training dollars.
It is unclear whether or not the Army’s investment in MTCs is being utilized to its full capacity given
that a set of standardized metrics to measure MTC capacity does not exist. In an effort to ensure
these resources are being utilized to their full capacity the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (VCSA)
has requested that the Center for Army Analysis (CAA), in coordination with G-3/5/7, develop a way
to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the Army’s MTC investment. The MCTA seeks to
develop quantitative metrics to measure MTC utilization and capacity and provide insights into the
effectiveness of the MTC facilities to accomplish the training mission. Six installations with MTC
facilities have been selected to provide data supporting capacity metrics to measure the three
primary resources that define MTC capacity: manpower, classroom space and equipment.
