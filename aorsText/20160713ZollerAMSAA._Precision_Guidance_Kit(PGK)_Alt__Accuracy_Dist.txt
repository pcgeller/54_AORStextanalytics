 Abstract:
The M1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) provides a simple, cost-effective solution to reducing the
ballistic dispersion for the M795 and M549A1 unguided 155mm artillery ammunition . The PGK fuze
contains GPS guidance and small aerodynamic fins to correct the munition in flight to follow a path
to the programmed target location.
Artillery delivery accuracy has always been modeled to fit a bivariate normal probability distribution
which has agreed fairly well with unguided artillery test results . PGK recently underwent operational
and lot acceptance testing to characterize its delivery accuracy distribution against its required
delivery accuracy of 50 meters circular error probable (CEP). Analysis of the PGK live fire test miss
distance data has determined it to not be normally distributed in range or deflection. An initial
analysis of PGK alternative accuracy representations has been executed by AMSAA to lay out the
options and highlight the benefits and limitations of each. Improving the PGK accuracy
representation will ultimately improve PGK weapon effectiveness estimates which could impact
operational PGK TTPs and theater ammunition analysis.
