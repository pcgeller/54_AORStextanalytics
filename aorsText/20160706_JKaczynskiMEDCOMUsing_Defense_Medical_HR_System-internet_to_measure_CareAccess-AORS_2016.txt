 Abstract:
Readiness and Access to Care are the top two priorities for the US Army Medical Command
(MEDCOM). Various systems exist to measure the medical aspect of readiness and patient Access
to Care standards. The Defense Medical Human Resources System-internet (DMHRSi) is the
mandated human resources management tool for the Defense Health Agency and is the only
Integrated Human Resources System within the Department of Defense. DMHRSi tracks provider
availability time and provider productivity through relative value units generated by a patient visit.
DMHRSi also tracks staff by specialty and office location in support of the MEDCOM mission.
DMHRSi feeds the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS) through four
digit functional cost codes. Identifying supply and demand for specific services is critical to
MEDCOMâ€™s mission and offers opportunities to increase productivity, access to care, and patient
satisfaction within the system. Current measures indicate the DMHRSi human interface error is
high. This presentation will provide an overview of a Regional Health Atlantic-Provisional study
underway purposed to uncover misreported time errors, errors in MEPRS code usage, and
discrepancies in DMHRSi transmission methods. The results of the study will inform future
incentivizing in the Integrated Resourcing and Incentive System (IRIS).
