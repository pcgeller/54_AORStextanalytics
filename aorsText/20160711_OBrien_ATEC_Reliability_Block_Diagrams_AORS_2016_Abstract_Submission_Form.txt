 Abstract:
Modeling and Simulation in system acquisition is often a tough sell due to the perceived cost.
However, if there was one and only one model to invest in – one with high return on investment and
maximum versatility – it would be a reliability block diagram (RBD).
In this presentation, the Army’s Center for Reliability Growth (co-led by the Army Evaluation Center
and the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity) continues its series on high-ROI methods for
system reliability analysis by showcasing the many applications of RBDs in test and evaluation –
from allocating resources during systems engineering, to optimizing statistical risks in test design, to
estimating system reliability, to estimating probability of failure-free operations during a mission that
utilizes a set of systems. As systems and the environments in which they operate become more
complex, a solid analytical foundation for understanding impacts arising from system reliability
characteristics becomes essential. RBDs are a versatile and affordable option for filling this need.
