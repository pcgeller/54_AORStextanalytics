 Abstract:
One of the primary purposes of combat simulations is to assess the operational impact of proposed
materiel solutions or alternatives. Although combat simulations can be used in lieu of testing to
expedite an analysis of alternatives, the performance data development process can be arduous.
While this process is necessary to maintain the integrity of the performance data used in Army
studies, one of the more common results are datasets that yield limited or no significant difference
between alternatives. The objective of this Design of Experiment (DoE) approach is not to replace
the data development process, but to generate representative performance data that can be tested
within a combat simulation. In theory, this will significantly reduce the amount of time and effort lost
generating performance data that may not differentiate between alternatives.
