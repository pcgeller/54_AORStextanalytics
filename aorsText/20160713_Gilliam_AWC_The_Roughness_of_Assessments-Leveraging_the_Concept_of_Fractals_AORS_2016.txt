 Abstract:
    Fractals and their underlying concepts may prove useful in both developing assessment
methodologies and explaining assessment results to decision-makers. Benoit Mandlebrot coined the
term “fractal” to define complex patterns which are self-similar across different scales. Through his
lifetime of research Mandlebrot identified specific instances in nature that can be measured and
expressed as fractals and further asserted that fractals are everywhere and that “fractal math can
find order within patterns that seem unknowably complicated.”
    Operations Research and Systems Analysis teams often undertake the weighty and "unknowably
complicated" responsibility of developing an assessment methodology to help decision-makers
understand the current environment and inform decision-making. These assessments, conducted at
all levels of war, can face significant contention regarding what to measure, how to measure, and
how to combine the measurements into a coherent product for the decision-maker, leading to
frustrated leaders and staffs alike. While not all-encompassing, fractals may provide insights into
developing strategic and operational level assessments using tactical level patterns or explaining
assessment methodology.
