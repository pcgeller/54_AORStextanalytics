Abstract:
The principle aim of most statistical analyses is to discover associations of explanatory variables
with the mean value of a response. In this talk, we will discuss an approach to discovering
associations explanatory variables may have with the probability that the response variable will
change. The purpose of such a model is to characterize not only the mean value of the response
variable, but also the likelihood that the response will change to a particular value. We use
operational data and Commander's Emergency Relief Program (CERP) spending in Iraq as an
example of where this type modelling might be appropriate.
