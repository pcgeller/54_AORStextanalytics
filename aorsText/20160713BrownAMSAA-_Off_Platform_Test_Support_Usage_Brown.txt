 Abstract:
Computerized Optimization Model for Predicting and Analyzing Support Structures (COMPASS) is
generally used to generate a Level of Repair Analysis (LORA). The objectives of this analysis were
to: capture test equipment usage between alternative maintenance concepts; and establish an
alternative methodology of COMPASS use by evaluating the cost and usage of test equipment.
AMSAA was requested by Program Manager (PM) of Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) to
provide a comprehensive optimized supportability/maintainability assessment that addressed the
maintenance and logistics issues associated with transitioning Abrams tanks from the SEPv2 to
SEPv3. The effort focused on the maintenance and supportability of specific legacy, common ,
redesigned and newly designed Class IX electronic Line Replaceable Units (LRU) and Line
Replaceable Modules (LRM) that define both SEPv2 and SEPv3 platform configurations. This effort
provided an economic assessment of the diagnostic screening of the LRUs/LRMs at different repair
locations with future off-platform test support equipment.
Off platform test equipment was analyzed using the COMPASS model developed and maintained by
the United States Army Material Command Logistics Support Activity (USAMC LOGSA).
COMPASS is the Army's standard model for performing a LORA. Three scenarios were evaluated
for the SEPv3 LORA. The first scenario (base case) was a PM defined combination of contractor
and organic repair. There are three LRUs that were potential candidates for off-platform test
support. The remaining 22 electronic LRUs/LRMs were assumed contractor supported. The Base
case reflected three organic LRU repair and 22 contractor supported LRUs/LRMs scenario. The
second scenario was fully contractor supported. This scenario did not utilize off-platform test support
because all repairs were performed by the contractor. The third scenario reflected the optimized
maintenance concept generated from COMPASS. The three LRUs that were potential candidates
for off-platform test support followed the most-economical maintenance concept. The remaining 22
LRUs/LRMs were repaired by contractor. All three scenarios evaluated the off-platform test support
usage. In combination with the SEPv3 results, two scenarios were evaluated for the SEPv2
off-platform test support. The first scenario (base case) reflected the current maintenance policy
(followed current SMR codes). The second scenario forced all LRU repair at the field level. Results
from the SEPv3 and SEPv2 LORAs were combined to show a total off-platform test support usage
for the Abrams program. Results showed a potential cost savings by downsizing the number of test
equipment at the field level and still reaching the target operational availability.
