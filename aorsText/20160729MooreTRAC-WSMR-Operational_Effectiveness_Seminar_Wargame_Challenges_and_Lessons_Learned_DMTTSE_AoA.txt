Abstract:
The Army and the Office of Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD
CAPE) initiated efforts to identify, develop, and procure a potential replacement capability for the
Gator mine system – an air-delivered obstacle with both antivehicle and antipersonnel landmines –
given the anticipated loss of Gator mine system due to policy and battery life expiration. These
efforts resulted in OSD CAPE directing the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)
Analysis Center (TRAC) on 1 July 2015 to lead the execution of the DMTTS&E Increment I AoA.
As part of the operational effectiveness analysis, TRAC conducted a Seminar Wargame in May of
2016, the purpose of which was to determine the operational impacts of the proposed materiel
alternatives. To ensure the wargame produced valid outcomes, technical and tactical subject matter
experts from over 15 Army and Joint agencies participated in the assessment of the proposed
alternatives within the context of 2 vignettes.
This presentation will discuss the wargame methodology, objectives, approach, and conclude with a
discussion of challenges faced during planning and execution. The brief will highlight challenges
associated with the evaluation of operational risk, analysis of operational versus tactical impacts,
and the design of an effective wargame. Some background material on the AoA will also be
provided for context.
