 Abstract:
As the demand for wargaming grows, it is clear that the skills needed to design, develop, conduct,
and analyze wargames are not well known, or if known, not well implemented. There are still many
“wargames” being conducted that are little more than BOGGSATs (bunch of guys and gals sitting
around a table), as evidenced by the lack of useful wargaming results from many of DoD’s higher
level wargaming events. This presentation provides an overview of analytic wargaming and
wargaming's best and worst practices.
