 Abstract:
Loosely defined as the partitioning of a social network’s N actors into P non-overlapping positions
which are linked by a pattern of ties, blockmodeling has emphasized the necessity of incorporating
multiple relations since its earliest formulation (White, Boorman, & Breiger, 1976; Boorman & White,
1976). As White et al. (1976) argue in their seminal paper, “many different types of tie are needed to
portray the social structure of a population” (p. 739). However, despite this foundational emphasis
and several notable exceptions (i.e., Baker, 1986; Borgatti & Everett, 1992; Batagelj, Ferligoj, &
Doreian, 2007; Brusco, Doreian, Steinley, & Satornino, 2013; Ziberna, 2014), the vast majority of
published research over the past 40 years has focused on solving blockmodels for a single relation.
When multiple relations exist, a reductionist approach is often employed, where the relations are
either stacked or aggregated into a single matrix, allowing the researcher to apply single relation
blockmodeling techniques. Nonetheless, this simplification can mask structural nuances within the
individual relations.
Moreover, while improved methods for solving single relation blockmodels have been immensely
valuable and are implemented in popular network analysis software (i.e., Pajek’s incorporation of
direct blockmodeling (Doreian, Batagelj, & Ferligoj, 2005)), they are ultimately heuristics.
Accordingly, while they provide good, locally optimal solutions, they cannot guarantee that better
fitting solutions do not exist. Again, there are several notable exceptions where researchers have
developed and implemented exact methods (i.e., Brandes & Lerner, 2010; Brusco, Doreian, Mrvar,
& Steinley, 2013; Brusco & Steinley, 2009); however, these methods exist for a single relation.
Accordingly, in this paper we extend Brusco and Steinley’s (2009) exact procedure to the
exploratory blockmodeling of multiple relation, mixed-mode networks. In particular, given (a) N1
actors, (b) N2 events, (c) an (N1 x N1) binary one-mode network depicting the ties between actors,
and (d) an (N1 x N2) binary two-mode network representing the ties between actors and events, we
use integer programming to simultaneously find the globally optimal (P1 x P1) actor-by-actor and
(P1 x P2) actor-by event image matrices, along with their associated partitions. Given the
computational complexity of this problem, we also develop an algorithm to generate a minimal set of
non-isomorphic image matrices of size (P1 x P1 | P1 x P2) greatly reducing the total number of
image matrices that must be fit when compared to the set of all possible (P1 x P1 | P1 x P2) image
matrices. We illustrate these concepts using a simple, hypothetical example, and we apply our
technique to a network of nations.
