 Abstract:
For years, defense industry partners have raised concerns that LPTA source selection has been
inconsistently and sometimes improperly applied. They argue that this inconsistent and improper
use of LPTA impacts the equity balance between the Department of Defense (DoD) and industry:
DoD's objective to get the right product or service at the right time for the right price, with industry's
objectives to provide value and excellence in services and products while sustaining profitability.
Recent DoD guidance and initiatives have attempted to strengthen the use of LPTA and to ensure it
is only used in appropriate situations. This analysis provides a comparison of best value source
selection approaches (LPTA and Tradeoff) in the areas of usage, process, and impacts to industry
and the Army. The analysis shows that LPTA is being used almost as often as Tradeoff in best
value selections, saves the Army time and money, without greater adverse impacts to industry.
