 Abstract:
Ever since von Clausewitz used the term “fog of war” to describe the uncertainty of actions in war it
has been equated to a lack of information about one’s own - and one’s friends and foes - strengths
and weaknesses. With the movement of actions associated with war (espionage, sabotage, and
other malicious actions) onto computer systems and networks we are faced with a difficult problem;
too much information. Systems generate logs with thousands of entries a minute, network traffic
flows non-stop, and hundreds of thousands of messages are sent per day. This has resulted in a
data deluge for network defenders attempting to identify nefarious activity within all of the noise.
Akin to insufficient data penetrating the fog of war we are now faced with an overabundance of data
which obscures the intent and actions of belligerent actors.
This presentation will discuss the data deluge and the big data sets it creates. It will then propose
solutions on how we can begin coping with, and handling, the deluge by using automated processes
and machine learning to assist in filtering, screening, and interpreting actions and behaviors on
computer systems. A strong emphasis is placed on the human component of these systems and
the unique abilities they bring which automated systems are unable to match.
