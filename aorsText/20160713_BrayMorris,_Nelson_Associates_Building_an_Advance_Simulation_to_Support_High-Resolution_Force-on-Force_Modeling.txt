 Abstract:
Since the 1960s onset of modern FoF modeling, simulations have been driven by task sequences
defined by computer programmers. That was necessary since for many decades, military
operators/warfighters had no standard task language. In the 1990s, official Joint and Service task
lists were developed, establishing formal, doctrinally-linked semantics for the warfighter. This
language construct enables evaluation of individual system contribution to collective tasks (the
singular source for System-of-System conduct), mission performance and effectiveness. Also since
the 1960s, FoF models have employed combat entities with assigned, unchanging attributes.
Interactions have focused on ballistic events, on pristine platforms, for kill/ no-kill outcomes.
However, since the 1980s, platform models have existed to support detailed, mutable geometry so
as to maintain a running status of component state space. This state space can be mapped to
platform capabilities and then compared to task requirements per the formal task descriptors.
In order to support a high-resolution FoF model demonstration, a commercial tool (EXTEND-SIM)
has been chosen as the integrating implementation tool. Much of the model environment is based
on Army-generated data bases and analysis codes (e.g., MUVES-S2). Specifically, 1] a
three-phase mission will be described using the official Universal and Army Universal Task Lists
(UJTLs/AUTLs) setting the official task/ conditions/ standards paradigm, 2] high-resolution 3-D solid
geometric descriptions of the fighting platforms (> 3000 object pieces) in dynamic mode will be used
to estimate damage/ repair interactions with ballistic, logistic, etc., factors, and 3] employ Monte
Carlo methods for mission threads and interactions to gain insight into the statistical outcome space.
We will describe and show some of the high-resolution metrics that are generated and some of the
key remaining challenges.
