 Abstract:
Wargames and computer-based combat simulations are both analytic tools that can be useful if
properly used within the bounds of their limitations. Unfortunately, many organizations look for the
single analytic tool that can be used to answer any military study question, and often organizations
look to their combat simulations as the answer. The strengths and limitations of each tool will be
addressed, and how the two tools can be used together in a study will be examined.
