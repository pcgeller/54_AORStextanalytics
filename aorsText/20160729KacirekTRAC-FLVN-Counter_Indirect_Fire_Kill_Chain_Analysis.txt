 Abstract:
Near-peer adversaries employ indirect fire (IDF) systems that over match United States IDF
capabilities in both capability and capacity. Recent Russian operations and capabilities
demonstrated in Ukraine and Syria highlight an advanced ability to target ground formations through
various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance means and rapidly deliver massed IDF to
achieve both tactical and strategic goals. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis
Center (TRAC) conducted the Counter IDF Kill Chain Analysis in an effort to examine emerging
capabilities for countering or interdicting the threat IDF sequence of events, known as the kill chain,
and to show potential operational impacts on mission success.
The TRAC study team developed an approach that combined a thorough literature review with
process modeling and wargaming. The team researched threat IDF kill chain capabilities to
understand, decompose, and identify critical nodes vulnerable to disruption or attack; and used
process modeling to assess impacts of the emerging capabilities on the threat IDF kill chain. The
TRAC-developed Versatile Assessment Scenario Tool (VAST) provided the venue to assess
changes in the friendly and threat operational effectiveness within a near-peer scenario.
This presentation will describe the analytic scope, overall methodology, modeling and wargaming
insights, and potential areas for VAST improvement to support future wargaming and analysis of IDF
capabilities.
