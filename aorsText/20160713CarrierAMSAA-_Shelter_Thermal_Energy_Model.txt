   I certify that I am technically knowledgeable to review and approve the release of the information contained in
   the enclosed format. I fully understand the threat connected with open source publications from hostile
   intelligence sources and, in my judgment, the benefits of the release outweighs the potential damage to the
   essential secrecy of the item in question. I, therefore, conclude that it is in the best interest of AMSAA, AMC,
   Army or other DoD programs to release this information into the public domain.

Abstract:
This presentation documents the Shelter Thermal Energy Model (STEM), AMSM's physics-based
analysis tool that operates in the MATLAB® environment. With basic shelter information, the model
can predict the thermal energy required to keep a structure at a desired internal temperature and
humidity setting. It also uses the predicted thermal demand in conjunction with the Environmental
Control Unit (ECU) performance specifications to predict electrical power consumption which
ultimately contribute to fuel consumption rates based on connections to a generator or microgrid.
STEM was developed by AMSM as an energy analysis tool to support multiple projects and inform
science & technology decision making across the Department of Defense (DoD).
