Abstract:
The use of surveys for data collection purposes continues to increase in the Army, particularly
among the ORSA community. Understanding the rules and regulations governing surveys, as well
as best practices for administering surveys is key to effective utilization of this data collection tool.
This session will provide an understanding of surveys, survey planning considerations, methods of
survey administration, survey design considerations, types of survey questions, protection of human
subjects, survey analysis considerations, and resources for analysts. Examples from recent
Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) studies will be presented to
highlight principles of sound survey and assessment design, as well as the application of the
principles to a study.
