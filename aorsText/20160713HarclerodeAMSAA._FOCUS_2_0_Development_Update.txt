 Abstract:
The Fusion Oriented C41SR Utility Simulation (FOCUS) is a stochastic, discrete event, constructive
simulation developed by AMSAA to model and analyze the performance of ISR assets in tactical
vignettes. FOCUS has been utilized in several Army and Joint studies to rapidly perform
comparative analysis of sensor performance at the tactical level. FOCUS 2.0 is the first major
update to the simulation which will completely overhaul the software architecture to increase the
terrain "play-box," enable increased flexibility in defining ISR asset collection behaviors, and
generate output charts during simulation execution to eliminate or reduce post-processing times.
The new architecture is centered around an entity and capability "add-in" relationship and a new
process flow interface to allow users to build a variety of custom behaviors including target
acquisition timelines, dynamic mission sets, and intelligence processing, exploitation, and
dissemination (PED) flows. Development also includes the creation of the Tactical ISR Performance
Suite {TIPS) that encapsulates the AMSAA ISR performance methodologies into a standalone
Application Programming Interface.
