 Abstract:
To support and enhance the Commander, Resolute Support (COMRS) directed Force Structure
study, the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) designed and facilitated a counterinsurgency wargame
with experts from RS and officers from the Afghan National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF)
during the spring/summer of 2016. With the goal of gaining strategic insights into different force
structure options for the ANDSF, the CAA and RS teams collaborated on a hybrid wargame,
incorporating a few systems into the predominantly seminar-style platform. The system / tabletop
portion of the wargame enabled seminar discussion by allowing experts to talk through a more
structured process, consider the sequencing of events through time / space, and visualize the
issues. As with many issues of wargames in general, CAA and RS could not incorporate all the
details and complexities of reality into the project due to the time constraints. The team worked
closely with the sponsor to capture the acceptable amount of realism while being able to accomplish
the mission. This presentation will discuss the general approach, methodology, the CAA â€“ RS
working relationship, limitations of the results, and the overall command satisfaction with the
wargame.
