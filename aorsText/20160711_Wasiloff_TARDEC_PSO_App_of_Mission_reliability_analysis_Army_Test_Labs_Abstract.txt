 Abstract:
In this study, I define two tests at a US Army Research and Development lab as “missions” for reliability analysis. The
lab that is defined as the system of interest is the PEVEL, which is a part of the larger GSPEL group of laboratories and
test cells at TARDEC in Warren, MI. Mission reliability is defined as the probability that a system can successfully
complete a specified mission, given that all mission essential equipment is “up” at the start of the mission.
The two tests studied were observed in real-time throughout the development of this research paper and associated
deliverables. The tests studied are variants of the “Cold Start” test which attempts to determine if a vehicle soaked in
sub-zero temperatures can be started under normal procedures by the operator, simulating a cold-weather forward
operating base scenario. During those tests, the test subject was a Navistar MaxxPro MRAP vehicle. Operational
conditions of the test (temperature, wind speed, mission critical equipment and failure rates) are outlined, however,
details of the test subject are not disclosed as part of this research (vehicle specific conditions and kits).
The mathematical model used in this study is a direct adaption from the mission reliability product rule. All mission
critical equipment was modeled using the exponential model based on their real-life configuration and executed based
on the required time for mission success. This analysis took into account series, active parallel, r out of n, and standby
configurations as the mission dictated.
For this mission reliability analysis, the Exponential Model was chosen for modelling both test cases partly because of
mathematical convenience due to a constant failure rate, as is the industry standard convention. The Exponential
Model or “Constant Failure Rate Model” is used during the ‘Useful Life’ period of an item’s life, i.e., after the ‘Infant
Mortality’ period before Wear out begins. The Exponential Model is most often used in scenarios where electronic
equipment is present.
An executable excel model was created such that TARDEC management and other users could determine the effect of
different configurations, MTBF, and mission times would have on overall mission reliability. The model allows the user
to enter the type of distribution or model, the MTBF, phase required, and information on the phases themselves. What
results is an automatically calculated mission reliability figure.
The mission reliability method, calculation, and potential uses are outlined. Included in this research is an addition to
Dr. Jerrell Stracener’s process for mission reliability analysis: reliability return on investment analysis. In the return on
investment analysis section, I propose a process and template to calculate the return on additional (standby) mission
critical equipment in terms of cost savings from customer refunded work.
Reliability analysis for the remaining TARDEC and other DoD test labs is vital to the long-term success of the
organization, its customers, and the warfighters.
Assumptions of Study:
Reliability Requirement at test level. This allows us to conduct a mission reliability analysis as the “test” itself being the
mission of the lab. This is also important as it is what the customer is paying for, regardless if it is internal or externally
funded.
Constant failure rate for all mission equipment. Because of the nature of the lab in the current state, reliability data has
not been consistently collected. With the assumption of constant failure rate, I was able to rely on subject matter
expert information related to the exponential failure distribution.
All equipment up at t=0. This ground rule or assumption is important because it allows us to use reliability equations to
conduct the analysis. It is an accurate assumption because the organization will not begin a test if there is a piece of
equipment in a non-operational state.
All equipment is independent. With the exception of cooling tower and electricity (which are garrison owned and
operated), all of the equipment is independent of one another. For example, a failure of the main cell fan does not
necessitate a failure of the exhaust hookup over the life of a single test.
Each piece of equipment has 2 states. All equipment used in this particular test occupied only one of two states:
operational or non-operational. Standby mode, as shown later in this section, indicates that the equipment is
operational but not in use.
Study conducted in April 2016. Full presentation and white paper available.
