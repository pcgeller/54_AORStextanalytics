Abstract:
The U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) completed an Analysis of Alternatives
(AoA) to support a Milestone B decision for a chemical detector acquisition program. The detector
program is intended to upgrade the Joint Forces' chemical detection and identification capabilities
which may face an increasing threat in the future . Due to the unique challenges posed by chemical
detection , capability gaps are being addressed by three distinct increments , each requiring an AoA.
The AoA provided an analytical comparison of the operational effectiveness, risks, and costs of
potential solutions to gaps and shortfalls in operational capability. The results from the AoA will be
used to demonstrate each alternative's capability to address validated gaps with quantifiable
requirements and capability documents in support of a milestone decision.
