 Abstract:
Strategic wargaming supports the United States Army War College’s (USAWC) education, research,
and outreach missions. Through the planning, preparing, conduct, and reporting on strategic
wargames, the USAWC is able to provide information and insights into issues of a national or
military strategic nature to inform decision-making of the senior-most leaders of the US Army, our
fellow Services, and across the Joint Force. The USAWC conducts approximately 7-8 wargames per
year, principally for the Army Staff, Army Service Component Commands, Combatant Commands,
and occasionally other DoD and government organizations.
From the USAWC’s perspective, a strategic wargame is a structured, facilitated interaction between
experts on a topic that will inform and assist in future strategic decision making by improving
understanding of the pertinent issues. Results from a wargame can provide insights and options on
the employment and appropriate application of the instruments of national power.
Through the Strategic Wargaming Series, the USAWC conducts timely and relevant wargames to
address select issues of strategic importance to the US Army and the nation. USAWC usually
conducts its wargames on behalf of a sponsor to investigate, research, or analyze issues or areas
that other organizations are not typically addressing. These wargames commonly deal with
political-military issues at the high operational to strategic levels of war.
USAWC wargame participants include highly qualified experts from the USAWC staff, faculty and
students, US and foreign government departments and agencies, non-governmental organizations,
other academic institutions, and relevant think tanks from around the world. For USAWC and the
participants, there is inherent value in the exchanges of ideas and critical thought among a highly
qualified, diverse array of wargame participants. USAWC wargames help to build and expand
professional networks for regional and functional communities of interest.
