 Abstract:
A principal role of the US Army Research Laboratory’s Survivability/Lethality Analysis Directorate
(ARL/SLAD) is the execution of survivability/vulnerability (S/V) analyses of Army air and ground
combat vehicles, their constituent systems and sub-systems, and relevant critical components.
These analyses employ a variety of models, tools, and techniques, take place in a variety of
contexts—support of Live-Fire Test and Evaluation; analysis-of-alternatives studies; size, weight,
and power trade-off studies; system and/or component design; basic research; and others—and are
performed for a variety of customers throughout and external to the Department of Defense.
Within this exceedingly broad range of analytical competencies is the DESCENT (not an acronym)
rotorcraft autorotation optimization model. It is designed to provide first-order estimates of best-case
autorotation capability for a rotorcraft suffering an arbitrary degree of main-rotor power loss. The
software was designed to maximize computational speed and input flexibility, so that the widest
possible parameter space (e.g. initial flight conditions, vehicle weight, rotor size and inertia,
weighted priorities for landing states, etc.) can be feasibly considered in the course of an analysis.
In its most basic utility, DESCENT produces a velocity vector that represents the optimized landing
velocity for a rotorcraft in a given scenario. Typically the code is run iteratively over, at minimum, an
initial flight-condition envelope of relevance to the analyst, and then DESCENT’s predictions are
combined in some fashion to form an “average” end state. This value(s) can then used as input into
larger-scope S/V modeling, as a metric to evaluate possible design changes, or for other purposes.
One simplification in the original development of the DESCENT model was the assumption of a
single main rotor that was the sole major lifting surface, as in the UH-60 or AH-1. This did not affect
the code’s applicability to the majority of the Army inventory, and work-arounds were available for
addressing the CH-47 or other two-rotor vehicles. However, with the inception of the Future Vertical
Lift (FVL) program and its preceding technology demonstrator exercise Joint Multi-Role (JMR), the
Army’s S/V analysis needs will soon require significantly more flexibility in terms of rotorcraft
characteristics.
ARL/SLAD has responded to this challenge by significantly upgrading the capabilities of DESCENT.
Of greatest relevance to FVL/JMR support is the acceptance of a user-defined number of rotors at
arbitrary locations; this enables explicit consideration of multi-rotor, coaxial, and other
unconventional designs. Additional lift, control, and thrust sources are also possible; this supports
tilt-rotor and pusher-prop analyses. The algorithm for predicting successful transition to steady,
level flight at a reduced power level has been improved and made more robust in response to the
additional power availability in newer platforms. The post-processing visualization scripts have been
upgraded in order to better facilitate shifting between “active” parameters in a multi-dimensional
analysis. Finally, support documentation has been updated for more productive collaboration within
the broader S/V analysis community.
This presentation gives a background on various Army S/V analyses informed by DESCENT, talks
about the anticipated requirements of S/V models for the FVL and JMR programs, discusses the
new capabilities of DESCENT in the context of supporting non-traditional rotorcraft designs, and lays
out the various contributions to design and development of rotorcraft platforms that fast and flexible
physics-based survivability analyses are positioned to make.
