 Abstract:
For cyber security systems, particularly intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) that have
a modular framework of signature-based and anomaly-based detection tools, determining whether
and how to enhance the system-level performance depends on the individual tool effectiveness and
efficiency. However, each tool’s classification performance is usually not entirely known and may
only be estimated, in some cases, by in-depth manual analyses of tool alerts because labeled
datasets identifying network data as malicious, anomalous, or normal are limited, and attacks are
evolving in ways that are often indistinguishable from normal traffic. In addition, constraints on
computational resources may exist, where meeting system-level efficiency requirements help to
ensure situational awareness. We consider computational resources to be costs, and we define a
Computational Resources Cost Index (CRCI) to characterize the IDPS efficiency with one metric
that depends on memory usage, I/O, network, and tool run time. With a simple IDPS return on
investment (ROI) model, we demonstrate how to measure an individual tool’s contribution to
system-level performance, in a technological rather than financial context. We reveal that IDPS
efficiency and effectiveness for multiple tools and datasets may be combined into a single measure,
ROI, for relative comparison. Our suggested modeling approach is broad enough to be applied to
different types and configurations of network and/or host-based cyber security systems. We simulate
the ROI for a network intrusion detection system (NIDS), consisting of anomaly and signature-based
tools, applied to real-world normal, background, and Botnet network traffic from the CTU-13
Scenarios, where each Scenario is a packet capture of network traffic. With these 13 malware
scenarios, we measure ROI at the individual detection tool level and at the NIDS-level, and we show
how our ROI modeling approach can be used as a decision aid for determining whether an IDPS or
individual tool requires enhancements to meet objectives.
