 Abstract:
As a result of the horrific 16 July 2015 shootings at the Armed Forces Recruiting Center and
Reserve Center in Chattanooga, TN, the Department of the Army, in conjunction with sister services,
is determining how additional requirements to security and force protection measures will protect
Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coastguardsmen at off-installation Stand Alone Facilities
(SAFs). Traditionally, SAFs have limited organic capability to respond to emergency situations.
They are typically visible and accessible to the civilian populace by their design, purpose, or
location, as SAFs physically reside within a community apart from a standard installation. Examples
of SAFs include Recruiting Centers, campus-based ROTC programs located within universities, and
U.S. military activities that reside off-installation in federal, state, or leased facilities. The objective of
this study is to help inform leaders of the current status of SAFs so they can develop Arming
CONOPs should a threat arise requiring a decision to alter local force protection and security
measures. This analysis is pre-decisional, so this presentation will address the study plan and
methodology, while providing insight on how the study team overcame several challenges faced
when conducting this complex analysis.
