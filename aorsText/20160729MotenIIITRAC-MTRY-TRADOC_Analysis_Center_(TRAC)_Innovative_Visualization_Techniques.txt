 Abstract:
Describing the results of a technical study in a clear and concise manner for decision makers or
stakeholders is complex. In addition to this complexity, the experience level of an operations
research analyst could limit their choice of visualization techniques to aid in understanding the
context of the relationship of the results to the problem. Moreover, most analysts do not employ an
abstract visualization design method that could enable them to validate their proposed visualization
technique. In this presentation, we will discuss a methodology that uses an abstract visualization
typology structure that will enable the analyst to derive the correct type of visualization to use in an
explanatory analysis and validate the visualization is correct within their presentation context.
