 Abstract:
One of the challenges in planning future requirements is the absence of concrete assumptions. One
of the elements of the Quantitative War Reserve Requirements for Munition (QWARRM) study is
considering future force structure changes and the combat support and service support
requirements when estimating combat loads. By leveraging existing studies and modeled output, it
was possible to recycle existing data to determine a reasonable deployment profile by standard
requirements code (SRC) across multiple years. By cross multiplying the quantity of unique SRCs
in a given status with the SRC’s Combat Load (CL) it was possible to build a unique munitions
requirement for each time period.
 As a process improvement, the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) is developing an automated and
repeatable method to provide a quick-turn capability to construct an SRC time-line traversed with
SRC specific resources to present an aggregated time sensitive look at changing requirements. By
looking beyond the initial intended use of modeled output (MARATHON and FORGE) and identifying
the type of data generated from each model, it was possible to restructure existing information to
examine requirements and respond to supplemental queries outside the scope of the initial study
parameters.
