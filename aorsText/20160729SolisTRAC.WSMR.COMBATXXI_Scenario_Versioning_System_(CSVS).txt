 Abstract:
The Scenario Integration Tool Suite (SITS) is the Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st
Centuryâ€™s (COMBATXXI) next generation preprocessor (graphical user interface). SITS is designed
to assist creation of dynamic scenarios by providing a suite of scenario development tools (force
structure, unit layout, behavior (tactics, techniques, and procedures) development, communications,
fires), and validation cues for correctness and completeness before the scenario is executed in the
COMBATXXI model. A major goal of SITS is to provide new tools to decrease the time needed for
scenario development. One such tool is the COMBATXXI Scenario Versioning System (CSVS),
which allows multiple users to develop and integrate into a single scenario, near simultaneously,
using Subversion technology. This has the potential to decrease the scenario development timelines
supporting analyses of alternatives and to improve the integration process. This presentation will
describe how CSVS will improve dynamic scenario development.
