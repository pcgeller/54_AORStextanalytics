 Abstract:
LMI developed Peak and NextGen (PNG) as improved inventory management solutions for
non-forecastable items. Peak targets items which are statistically not forecastable due to infrequent
demand. Next Gen targets items with high demand frequency which are statistically not forecastable
due to unusually high demand variability.
THE PROBLEM
Non-forecastable items represent significant financial and support risk. While some of these
items simply do not justify the risk associated with stocking them, others must be stocked due to
weapons system support or some other critical warfighter need. These non-forecastable items
have traditionally been more difficult to procure, often because of long lead times. In addition,
non-forecastable items have the greatest risk for both excess stock and stock outages within any
given portfolio of items. If the risks associated with not stocking these items exceeds the risks of
stocking them and forecast-based models do not offer a viable solution, then how does PNG
determine when and how much to order?
THE SOLUTION
The PNG solutions enable quick decision making. PNG provides managers with trade-off curves
showing the simultaneous three-way trade-off between customer service, inventory value, and
the annual replenishment actions (buyer workload). By selecting a point on a curve, managers
set minimum and maximum stock levels, on an item by item basis, to achieve projected
business outcomes for the group. This approach replaces the inefficient, ineffective, and
potentially costly process of attempting to forecast the unforecastable. It eliminates developing
safety stock and order quantities from devalued data.
After two years of applying PNG to 500,000 DoD consumable hardware items, customer
service was much improved while inventory was reduced. Procurement workload was down
significantly, contributing to shorter lead-times. The workload reduction was down in both buys
generated and buys generated but later canceled. PNG reduced requirements churn and better
aligned material bought and sold, resulting in an annual savings of $400M in working capital.
THE FUTURE
Under OSDâ€™s Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Program (CIMIP), PNG
was extended to guide buy and repair decisions for reparable items. We will present criteria for
segmenting the Air Force reparable item population into sub-populations that perform best with
Peak, Next Gen, and the current forecast-based process. We will show simulation results on
applying PNG to their respective sub-populations, including trade-off curve options, near-term
financial and workload impacts, and benefits for weapon system support. Air Force Sustainment
Command is going forward with implementation of Peak, and is supporting further work to tune
Next Gen for weapon system support and to interface with downstream systems.
