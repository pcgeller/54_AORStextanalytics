 Abstract:
AMSAA calculates Probability of Incapacitation (P(I)) estimates for fragmenting munitions that are
used in combat simulations throughout the Army and Marine Corps. For direct-fire fragmenting
munitions, AMSAA calculates a P(I) estimate for many combinations of posture,
clothing/armor/helmet, casualty criterion, firer-to-target range, burst height, burst-to-target azimuth
angle, and burst-to-target range. Even for a modest number of munitions (11 ), the amount of data
can be overwhelming (76 million P(I) estimates). By training neural networks to learn the P(I)
values, AMSAA has developed a scheme to compress the data by a factor of one thousand or more
with no significant loss in accuracy. Smaller data sets could ease some of the burden of data
management on AMSAA's data customers, as well as take up less memory in their simulations.
Neural networks - and other "machine learning" algorithms such as genetic algorithms and
classification trees - have been used by the Army in many applications besides compression,
including predicting the terminal ballistics of kinetic energy projectiles, searching for optimal vehicle
configurations, designing new fragmenting warheads, detecting data outliers, and predicting risk.
Use of High Performance Computing will also be discussed.
