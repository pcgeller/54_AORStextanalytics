 Abstract:
In 2015 the first ever Army Modeling and Simulation Capability Portfolio Review (M&S CPR) was
spearheaded by the Army Modeling & Simulation Office (AMSO) to identify current M&S capabilities
and gaps. This presentation will describe the Army M&S CPR process and results; demonstrate
how AMSO facilitates Army Enterprise M&S solutions for critical Army M&S needs; how the process
enables communication and sharing between Army communities, Joint, and Industry partners; and
provides long term prioritized planning for M&S needs to address Army strategic goals. The M&S
CPR identified 394 Army M&S tools in active use and M&S enterprise gaps in the following areas:
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN); Cyber / Electronic Warfare (EW); Fires;
Intelligence; Network; Resourcing; Sensors; Terrain; and Workforce. Working groups for each M&S
gap area were formed to analyze and refine gaps, identify the communities impacted, and discover
ways to close gaps meeting Army needs and mission requirements. In February 2016, the working
groups and stakeholders were brought together in Fort Belvoir, VA for the first annual Army M&S
Gaps Forum to discuss M&S gap resolutions. The resultant courses of action provided to the Army
M&S Governance Forums included recommendations for policy updates, procedure changes,
capability sharing, studies for new research and methodology development, and improvements to
existing models and simulations. The processes and results documented in this presentation will
provide attendees with: A method to assess capabilities distributed across multiple organizations,
commands, and communities; insights on Army M&S gaps, areas needing support from Joint
Services, DOD, and Industry; and the Army enterprise approach to M&S capability gaps and how to
get involved.
