 Abstract:
The Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) 2020 Strategy put forth by the United States Army Training
and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) calls for the revitalization of professional military education
(PME) to cultivate a more adaptable and resilient NCO Corps. This presentation summarizes the
TRADOC Analysis Centerâ€™s (TRAC) efforts to analyze and interpret the results of a mixed methods
research study conducted by the Sergeants Major Academy across 10 training facilities and centers
of excellence. TRAC created an analysis framework to support instructional design for continuous
leadership development across all levels of PME. This presentation will discuss lessons learned for
future studies.
