 Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented the effectiveness of benzathine penicillin G
(BPG) prophylaxis at reducing all-cause acute respiratory disease (ARD) in military populations.
BPG is an antibiotic shot administered one time at the start of basic training to eliminate
streptococcal and staphylococcal infections that recruits bring with them to prevent further spread. It
is not effective against viral pathogens, and has an average duration of 4 weeks. Here, we build
models to quantify the extent to which BPG availability is predictive of ARD.
METHODS: We fit and k-fold cross-validated four random forest models to surveillance data from
1991 – 2016 from six Army installations. Dependent variables tested were weekly ARD counts,
weekly ARD rates, weekly scaled ARD rates and weekly ARD quintile. Covariates in each model
were BPG availability, adenovirus vaccine availability, post, latitude, trainee population size, year,
month, and season. Variable importance was measured by node purity, which is the mean decrease
in the Gini index at each tree split.
RESULTS: The best-performing model used ARD case counts as the dependent variable, and
explained nearly 80% of the variance in the data with a mean absolute error of 8.01. Population size
and year had the highest node purities, followed by installation and administration of adenovirus
vaccine. BPG availability was the fifth most important variable and its node purity score was less
than one fourth that of population size. BPG availability was not among the four most important
predictors of all-cause ARD in any of the four models.
DISCUSSION: These results indicate that BPG availability is not a strong predictor of all-cause
ARD cases in military populations. BPG prophylaxis may not reduce ARD morbidity at the
population level when adenovirus is well controlled. We recommend performing streptococcal
infection-specific surveillance and analysis to examine the true effectiveness of BPG in this
population. Simulation studies could provide guidance as to what alternative or concurrent
interventions—including a revised BPG regimen— could further reduce all-cause ARD morbidity in
military populations.
