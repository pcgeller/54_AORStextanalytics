 Abstract:
The U.S. Army Intelligence and Sensors Modeling and Simulation (M&S) communities have come
together in 2015 and 2016 to identify cross-community M&S gaps as part of the Army M&S
Capability Portfolio Review (CPR). The initial CPR efforts recognized fourteen M&S gaps specific to
the areas of intelligence and sensors, which impacted multiple Army communities (Acquisition,
Analysis, Experimentation, Intelligence, Test and Evaluation, and Training) and prevent meeting
Army mission needs. A working group was developed, leveraging intelligence and sensor subject
matter experts from Army and Joint stakeholders, to define the M&S gaps, prioritize these gaps, and
recommend courses of action for delivering M&S capability. This presentation will cover the M&S
CPR gap process used, provide an overview of the 43 refined intelligence and sensor gaps,
expound on the top 9 prioritized gaps, and summarize the recommended courses of action, which
will be presented to the U.S. Army M&S Governance Forums. The M&S CPR Gap process will be a
continuing effort with annual Gap Forums designed to gather M&S gaps and recommendations for
gap closures.
