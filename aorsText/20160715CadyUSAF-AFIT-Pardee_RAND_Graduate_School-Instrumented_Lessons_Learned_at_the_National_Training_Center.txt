 Abstract:
This article uses open-source literature to explore the past and present state of lessons learned (LL)
collection and analysis at the National Training Center (NTC). The NTC, which began training troops
in 1981, was established with two central goals: to train the rotational unit and to provide
lessons-learned to aid in training across the Army. The NTC has been always focused primarily on
the former, but has a rich history of efforts towards improving the latter. Ultimately however, these
efforts resulted in a LL system that is largely qualitative in nature; despite many attempts to use the
enormous amounts of instrumented data collected each rotation. This primarily occurred because of
three factors: poor data quality, inadequate computing resources, and institutional resistance. I
propose that a new analytical methodology which takes advantage of this instrumentation data from
NTC is today not only possible, but would be a valuable addition to lessons learned processes by
providing highly detailed, quantitative LL analysis that generally reflects operational realities.
