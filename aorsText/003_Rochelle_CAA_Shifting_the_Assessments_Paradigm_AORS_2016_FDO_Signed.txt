 Abstract:
As the model for deployments continues to shift in the future – characterized by greater emphasis on
the host nation military taking the lead, limited permissions and authorities, shorter personnel
rotations, and increased use of technology in lieu of Service members – the assessments paradigm
must also evolve. In order to deliver an assessment that will provide the commander salient
insights, individuals leading assessments must trigger a paradigm shift. Rather than primarily
focusing on the collection of data and the measurement of progress against effects and objectives,
they must first comprehensively identify, examine, and mitigate the impact of systemic challenges
present in the operational environment. A solid assessment framework will provide insights, but an
operational assessment’s effectiveness lies in its ability to inform the commander and enable
him/her to direct actions that advance the campaign. Failure to identify and mitigate the impact of
systemic challenges on the assessment, and other staff work, ensures the assessment will not
inform the Commander’s decisions about the campaign or improve the effectiveness of operations.
Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) serves as an excellent case study of how
systemic challenges require a shift in the assessments paradigm. Systemic challenges present at
CJTF-HOA, while not exhaustive, include a Joint Manning Document that does not support
requirements for the current mission, limited legal and fiscal authorities, high personnel turnover
(approximately 150% annually), and limited boots on the ground throughout the area of operations
(limited sensors). These systemic challenges, and various other factors, consistently impact the
value of the insights the assessment provides the commander and the staff. Recently implemented
best practices designed to mitigate the impact of systemic challenges highlighted above will be
discussed.
