 Abstract:
The Army of the future depends critically on ongoing decisions and investments. Since physical
experimentation is expensive and limited, the Arm relies on computer simulation to help decide how
best to equip, man, organize, employ, train, supply, and maintain the force. These computer
models can be extremely complex, with thousands of potentially interacting factors and many
sources of uncertainty. Efficiently exploring these high-dimensional models requires the effective
use of design of experiments (DOE). Fortunately, recent breakthroughs in the science for exploring
computational models enables much more powerful large-scale simulation studies. In fact,
researchers and students in the SEED Center for Data Farming (http://harvest.nps.edu) at the Naval
Postgraduate School are routinely doing experiments that were not available only a decade agoâ€”
often simultaneously varying many scores of variables of different types and levels. This
presentation provides an overview of modern data faming and introduces a portfolio of experimental
designs for efficiently obtaining insights from high-dimensional models. These designs offer the
researcher both design and analysis flexibility. The design flexibility allows analysts to readily
generate designs for a large number of input factors of various types within reasonable sampling
budgets. The analysis flexibility provides analysts with the ability to fit many different meta-models
to multiple output measures. The presentation will include an example analysis using these
techniques and a brief tutorial of one of our more useful design generating tools.
