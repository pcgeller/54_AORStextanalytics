Abstract:
4th Infantry Division (4ID) serves as the U.S. Army’s only balanced division, operating with each a
Light, Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Team formation. As military operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan continue to change from stability and wide area security to a lower demand train and
assist mission, the Army can refocus on offense and defense tasks. This transition to a conventional
adversary focus does not restrict the application of stability honed lessons learned in campaign
assessment techniques.
With limited resources, campaign plans assist Army leaders balance competing requirements across
multiple continents spanning quality of life to warfighting. They expect more from an assessment
product than a simple information presentation. ORSA’s have a key role in providing a synchronized
assessment plan communicating campaign progress and informing reallocation of resources in
achievement of desired effects. A successful assessment provides clarity in describing chaotic and
complex systems, and is relevant and useful to making difficult decisions.
