 Abstract:
Knowing the number of young people available to be recruited into the Army would help Recruiting
Command deploy resources efficiently. In any particular area, the number of young people available
to be recruited into the Army in any particular area depends on population size, but also on local
attributes of the population that affect eligibility (for example, prevalence of obesity or diabetes) and
propensity to enlist (for example, proximity of universities). Obvious measures related to the number
of people available include the number of recruits from last year and the number of local leads from
that area. However, these measures all suffer from a “chicken-and-egg” problem. They all increase
as a function of increased recruiter effort, and recruiters are allocated based on an area’s past
production. In this work, we cluster about 34,000 ZIP codes according to their values of about 350
variables derived from open sources which measure data on health, income and taxes, local
employment and payrolls, military and veteran populations, and secondary institutions. These
variables are frequently missing, are often measured at county, rather than ZIP code, level, and are
highly dependent. We reduce dependency and control for over-represented variable types (such as
population health variables), by first partitioning the 350 variables into a small number of variable
types and then clustering ZIP codes into a small number of homogenous clusters for each group of
variables. We use a novel measure of inter-observation distance that is resistant to missing values,
outliers, and transformations and operates on both categorical and numeric attributes. Performance
is measured by comparing the clustering to the numbers of national leads, which should be largely
immune from the effect of local recruiter effort. Recruiting Command can use the clustering to aid in
assigning recruiting resources to, and determining recruiting tactics, in different ZIP code types.
