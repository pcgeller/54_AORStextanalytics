 Abstract:
The Army Chief of Staff has stated that "Readiness is #1 ... And there is no other #1." The key to
success is tackling readiness early in the system acquisition process where cost-effective design
and logistics innovations can be readily implemented. Advancing system readiness involves
pursuing three prongs: (1) Reliability; (2) Maintainability; and (3) Logistics Performance. If you
improve any of these three prongs, readiness increases; however, the cost and time ramifications
for each can be vastly different.
Early engineering activities (thermal analysis, vibrations analysis, fatigue analysis, etc.), reliability
growth testing, and load characterization are essential for the reliability prong. System geometries ,
Condition Based Maintenance, and common tools are critical for the maintainability prong. Lastly,
for logistics performance, it's all about having the right parts and procedures in the right place at the
right time. The vastness of the trade space associated with these three prongs can be
overwhelming without careful consideration of the quantifiable attributes and relationships of each.
This presentation will show examples of the underlying attributes and relationships and how they
each provide critical information for determining the most beneficial solutions for improving
equipment readiness.
