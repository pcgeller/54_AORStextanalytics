Abstract:
The briefing presents the results of an analysis which utilized AMSAA's Sample Data Collection
(SDC) and Analysis information to compare the M1A2 SEP V1 with the M1A2 SEP V2 in terms of
age, optempo, reliability, maintainability, downtime, and replacements parts cost. This study
provided a unique opportunity to compare a large sample of M1A2 ABRAMS before and after a
vehicle upgrade (by vehicle serial number) under SDC at Ft. Hood, TX.
