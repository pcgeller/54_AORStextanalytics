 Abstract:
ABSTRACT: In 2009, the Army canceled the M113 program because of shortfalls in force
protection and mobility highlighted during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 2012 Armored
Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) identified requirements for replacing
the M113 in the ABCTs. However, there remain some 1,200 M113 Family of Vehicles (FoVs) in
Echelons above Brigade (EAB) Field Artillery (FA) and Engineer Brigades (BDEs) without a plan for
replacement. A 2012 Congressional Inquiry Study found that these units face high risk to mission
accomplishment when operating with M113s. In April of 2015, the TRADOC Analysis Center was
tasked to conduct an Analysis of Alternatives on the M113 FoV in EAB. The purpose of the AoA
was to inform senior Army decision makers with analytic evidence to support requirements
documentation and acquisition decisions.
The development of replacement courses of action (COAs) was one of the most complicated
aspects of the study. The M113 FoV in EAB serves in both general purpose and mission command
mission roles, resides in two different branches and is employed from the squad level up to the
battalion commander. The M113 FoV’s replacements need to fill the same wide range of
capabilities at an affordable cost. The study screened hundreds of candidates to arrive at four
alternatives: Stryker Flat-Bottom Hull, Stryker Double-V Hull, Mobile Tactical Vehicle Light with
additional Force Protection, and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle. The study considered many
combinations of these alternatives between pure fleet and mixed fleet, new procurement and
reusing existing Army inventories. Using cost, performance, operational impact, and risk analysis,
the study was able to recommend feasible and affordable COAs that mitigated capability gaps and
met the warfighter’s needs.
This presentation will discuss the study’s method for developing and evaluating its COAs.
