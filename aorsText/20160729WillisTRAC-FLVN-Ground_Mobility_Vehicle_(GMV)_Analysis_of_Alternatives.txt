 Abstract:
The Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)
initiated the GMV AoA in September of 2015 in support of a future Acquisition Category (ACAT) III,
Milestone C decision. The purpose of the AoA is to evaluate commercial off-the-shelf vehicle
capabilities to enable the rapid employment of squad-sized light infantry forces. The TRADOC
Analysis Center (TRAC) established a study team to examine the alternatives that could mitigate the
capability gap resulting from the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) lack of sufficient enhanced
tactical mobility to rapidly transport and maneuver forces across extended distances as part of a
Joint Forcible Entry team in all environmental conditions.
The GMV AoA Study Directive identified two study issues for the AoA to address: (1) assess the
cost, schedule, and performance risks for each alternative considering life-cycle cost, weight, and
size of a vehicle, and (2) assess IBCT operational effectiveness for each alternative considering
maneuverability, fixed-wing employment, and rotary-wing employment.
This presentation will discuss how the study team assessed operational effectiveness of the GMV
alternatives by focusing on the transportability and maneuverability of the alternatives within two
scenario vignettes, both involving offset drop zone/landing zones. It will include methodologies for
the two efforts and outline various challenges as well as lessons learned throughout the study.
