 Abstract:
4th Infantry Division (4ID) serves as the U.S. Army’s only balanced division, operating with each a
Light, Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Team formation. As military operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan continue to change from stability and wide area security to a lower demand train and
assist mission, the Army can refocus on offense and defense tasks. Staff sections throughout major
headquarters (HQ) are now returning to or relearning root doctrine. However, ORSAs do not have
the same foundation as fellow combat arms officers. ORSA’s are learning where we fit into the HQ’s
staff as well as how to best support current operations in both the garrison and tactical
environments. With a focus on the tactical environment, the division ORSA enhances HQ processes
applying analytical skill in wargaming methods.
4ID uses wargame techniques before and during decisive action operations. Before operations, step
four of the military decision making process (MDMP) leverages wargaming to measure each course
of action (COA). From the perspective of game theory, Divisions and adversaries are players whose
strategies of applying and risking combat power to determine outcomes in terms of control, create
payoffs of military power and enable other elements of national power. Divisions are in a position to
directly apply tactical land power as part of a unified action to defeat the enemy and establish
conditions in which to achieve the joint force commander’s end state. Divisions bridge the gap
between the science of war and operational art. During planning, the ORSAs collaborate with staff to
develop a logical framework connecting strategic considerations with operational objectives and
tactical constraints. The MDMP wargame establishes an expectation of operational success and
refined risks and opportunities for each COA within this framework. The wargame also informs the
ORSA of what metrics are important in identifying conditions for timing transitions. The result of
MDMP is an approved COA of deliberate tactical actions planned to achieve operational objectives.
During operations, the targeting and orders process further coordinates and refines these tactical
actions in order to shape the close fight for the brigades. U.S. Division Commanders allocate limited
resources to accomplish potentially competing outcomes for non-military pay-offs while in conflict
with multiple competing adversaries and their often ambiguous and dynamic intentions. This
estimation of current situation and visualization of tactical actions and counteractions resulting in
desired progress is also wargaming. The commander should not need to do this alone. The Division
battle rhythm is a series of events that collects and processes pertinent information to inform the
commander. 4ID’s last battle rhythm event is the Warfighting Function Update (WfFU), where the
battle’s next 72 hours is discussed among the Commander and his primary staff using only a map
and whiteboard. This discussion results in refined guidance and directives for the Division. A
Division’s application of wargaming techniques and generation of insight can help leaders make
difficult decisions.
