 Abstract:
The Army requires access to secure, reliable information out to the tactical edge. Currently, satellite
communication (SATCOM) is the only means for providing this connectivity when maneuvering
forces are beyond line-of-sight of their command post, other units, and coalition forces. As the
Department of Defense military wideband satellites reach end of life, the Services must be prepared
to defend their wideband SATCOM requirements for a future wideband SATCOM analysis of
alternatives. The Headquarters, Department of the Army G-3/5/7 initiated the Army Wideband
SATCOM Bandwidth Study in November of 2015 and directed the TRADOC Analysis Center
(TRAC) establish a study team to determine Army wideband SATCOM requirements to support
deployed forces conducting expeditionary maneuver in the 2030 timeframe.
The study team combined an extensive literature review, network connectivity analysis, and
operational assessment to develop the Army wideband SATCOM requirements in terms of
throughput by warfighting function and echelon. By combining the outputs from two different models,
utilizing two operational scenarios, and current Army operational data, TRAC developed a baseline
communication requirement. Subject matter experts (SME) were consulted to validate or construct
communication requirements to fill data voids in the demand signal. SMEs also prioritized the
communications requirements based on the missions and activities. The study team also examined
operational impacts of transport convergence and threat jamming/scintillation on throughput
requirements.
This presentation will describe the study scope, methodology, and data techniques used to develop
the estimated throughput requirement and insights on transport converge and threat
jamming/scintillation. It will also outline various analytic challenges as well as lessons learned
throughout the study.
