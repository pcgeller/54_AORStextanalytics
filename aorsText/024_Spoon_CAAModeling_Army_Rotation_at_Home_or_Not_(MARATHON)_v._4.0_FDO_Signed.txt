 Abstract:
Modeling Army Rotation at Home or Not (MARATHON) is the premier force structure analysis
platform for the Army. The Center for Army Analysis (CAA) routinely uses MARATHON for
high-visibility projects, including Total Army Analysis (TAA), Operational Availability (OA), the
Quadrennial Defense Review, and the National Commission on the Future of the Army. With its
inception in 2003, CAA has enhanced and expanded MARATHON to keep pace with the
ever-growing complexities of simulating Total-Army supply and demand scenarios against disparate,
detailed force generation and deployment policies. MARATHONâ€™s latest evolution - v. 4.0 - presents
simultaneous advancements in performance, flexibility, scalability, and portability with no cost in
licensing fees or dependence on proprietary software beyond the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and
is designed to meet the challenges of analyzing the Sustainable Readiness Model, large-scale force
structure portfolio analysis, and more. Additionally, MARATHON 4.0 brings a growing suite of
dynamic animation capabilities to the table, along with a Zoomable User Interface (ZUI) for
impressive interactive visuals. This presentation will detail advancements in Marathon 4.0, and
relate them to requirements driven by TAA and SRM.
