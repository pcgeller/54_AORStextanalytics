 Abstract:
Starting in 2015, the Intelligence and Security Commend (INSCOM) initiated a pilot program to
provide additional intelligence support to Regional Cyber Centers. This effort is currently named the
Defensive Cyber Operations Intelligence Support (DCOIS). As part of this pilot, the INSCOM ORSA
Cell developed analytical techniques and tools that assist analysts in extracting relevant cyber data
from intelligence data bases. These analytical techniques incorporate data fusion and entity
extraction techniques using the R Programming language to produce a summary of cyber entities
found in intelligence community databases. These entities are then uploaded to Cyber Situational
Awareness Analytical Capabilities (CSAAC) to assess status and prioritize efforts. This tool
increases the effectiveness of analysts in leveraging intelligence community data for use in
Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO).
