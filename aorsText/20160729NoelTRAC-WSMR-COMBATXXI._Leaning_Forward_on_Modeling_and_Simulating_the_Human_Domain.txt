 Abstract:
The Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century (COMBATXXI), a high-resolution,
entity-level, stochastic, combat simulation is the Armyâ€™s premier modeling and simulation tool for
undertaking analyses of alternatives for future combat capabilities and conceptual systems.
Increasingly, analysts are asked to evaluate capability gaps in support of Human Dimension
initiatives. These initiatives require an amplified capability and fidelity to model and simulate the
human in context. A paper from the National Academy of Science points to Agent Based Modeling
(ABM) as the only type of modeling and simulation capable of capturing the human domain for
analysis of human social, organizational, and doctrinal performance. A review of literature of ABM
used in Human Dimension analysis will support this view. Implications for COMBATXXI, a form of
ABM, will be discussed.
