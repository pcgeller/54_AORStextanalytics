 Abstract:
4th Infantry Division (4ID) serves as the U.S. Army’s only balanced division, operating with each a
Light, Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Team formation. As military operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan continue to change from stability and wide area security to a lower demand train and
assist mission, the Army can refocus on offense and defense tasks. Staff sections throughout major
headquarters (HQ) are now returning to or relearning root doctrine. However, ORSAs do not have
the same foundation as fellow combat arms officers. ORSA’s are learning where we fit into the HQ’s
staff as well as how to best support current operations in both the garrison and tactical
environments. With a focus on conducting Expeditionary Operations
Division/Corps ORSA has a unique opportunity to be a key piece of the headquarters battle rhythm
and provide critical information for both the Commander as well as division staff working groups.
Division/Corps ORSA teams have gained utilization and popularity through the operations
conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 15 years. However, there is limited doctrine on
where the ORSA team fits into the staff and what ORSA specific products, procedures, or actions
best support the command when executing Expeditionary Operations. This presentation provides a
division level concept of how the collective Assessments team comes together in the MDMP
process, feeding into the Assessment Working Group, Targeting Process, and finally assisting the
Command in making key decisions.
