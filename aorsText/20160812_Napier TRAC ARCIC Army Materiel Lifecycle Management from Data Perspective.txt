 Abstract:
Army Materiel Lifecycle Management from a data perspective.
Realities of a budget constrained future with more capable threats require more sophisticated use of
Army data systems, information technology and analytical methods to provide senior Army leaders
with information that permits more efficient use of appropriated dollars.
This brief will talk about how alignment of stove piped data across The Army Materiel Lifecycle
process allows traceability of dollars across all product lines. How current acquisition programs
align to capabilities needed by the Army and how capability gaps can be closed through targeted
Science and Technology. An objective system could help manage seven appropriations containing
over 20% of the Army budget with over $50B per year under Capital Investment.
How we can link data to provide:
1) relative value scores for Army Required Capabilities (See ARCIC CNA)
2) linkages to current programmed and fielded materiel solutions (Acquisition Programs)
3) links system of systems materiel to allow for more control over capability set fielding
4) visibility over production schedules and dollar allocation across all product lines
5) ability to aggregate individual programs into resource portfolios, Army Warfighting Challenges,
Capabilities, Capability Gaps or any other standard aggregation that can be mapped to individual
pieces of equipment
6) facilitates divestiture and modernization path decisions
7) informs materiel readiness status of fielded units
8) informs what impacts are expected due to resource decisions at a State and local level
9) provides more efficient program and project management of programs
10) facilitates best practice and sharing of specialized programs
Overall, the data system needs to leverage the strength of the Army Business Systems, create data
linkages and link materiel solutions to more efficiently and effectively manage programs, manage
portfolios and make resource informed value decisions based on Army Capital Investments.
