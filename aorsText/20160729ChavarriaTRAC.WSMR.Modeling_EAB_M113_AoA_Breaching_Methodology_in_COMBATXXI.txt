 Abstract:
In the conduct of the Echelons Above Brigade (EAB) M113 Replacement Analysis of Alternatives
(AoA), the TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) developed two deliberate breaching operations in the
Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century (COMBATXXI) model, one requiring breaching a
wire and tank ditch and the second an antitank/antipersonnel minefield. Both breaches employed
current suppress, obscure, secure, reduce, and assault (SOSRA) doctrine.
This presentation will describe the methodology implemented in a COMBATXXI scenario to model
the breaching of the two obstacle zones, challenges encountered, and solutions to overcome the
challenges. Highlights will include how a custom behavior logger helped the study team quickly
identify issues with the modeling, debugging of breaching behaviors, tracking damaged vehicles
throughout the scenario, and performing calculations for analysis.
