 Abstract:
The history of Army ballistic direct-fire lethality/vulnerability goes back to the late 1950s and workers
at the Ballistic Research Laboratory. Prior to this time, armored fighting vehicle (AFV)
characterization was principally in terms of armor protection. However, in the late 1950s, analysts
began considering two key additional factors when assessing ballistic hits: a] reduction in platform
ability to move, shoot, or communicate, and b] measures relating to reduced mission effectiveness.
To bring discipline to this task, workers on the current main battle tanks (M-47s and M-48s)
generated a list of major platform components/subsystems. Approximately 400 entries were
generated. In order to address factor a], a group of engineers was assembled to map the effect of
each component/subsystem on each of the platform performance abilities (i.e., move, shoot,
communicate).
To address factor b], a number of missions was subjectively defined; for example, overwatch, attack,
hasty retreat, etc. The influence of each performance metric to the successful prosecution of the
mission was then established. By combining factors a] and b] a relationship was formed between
component/ subsystem loss and mission effectiveness.
These pieces provided the foundation of what was called the Standard Damage Assessment List
(SDAL). Because of the size of the variable space (e.g., different missions, round hit location, hit
dispersion, etc.), a sequence of averages was imposed on the core metrics having to do with
platform movement, firepower, and catastrophic outcome. In the end, the metrics, all generated on
the unit interval, were labelled probabilities and have been used to support wargame interactions for
over 50 years.
Today, much has changed in the characterization of warfare analysis. Engineering analyses have
been structured for many AFVs in order to relate component loss to performance decrement.
Military tasks (together with conditions and standards) are now codified for the Joint and Service
worlds. Thus a clear linkage can be established between the status of platform components and
each point in a time/task resolved mission.
In this paper we will review the history of direct-fire Kill Probabilities, what issues have surfaced, and
how new methods provide optional means for supporting a gamut of analytic needs.
