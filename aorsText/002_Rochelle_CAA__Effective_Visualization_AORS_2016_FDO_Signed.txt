Abstract:
The demand for analytical underpinnings to inform decisions within the Department of Defense
continues to grow. This increased demand for analytical products places pressure on analysts to
more quickly model and analyze increasingly complex problems. The baseline analytical tools (e.g.
Excel) provided, however, often make visualizing the problem, retracing the analystâ€™s process,
and/or replicating the work exceedingly difficult.
Programming provides analysts one solution, but not every analyst is a programmer. Fortunately,
other tools, such as SPSS Modeler and Tableau, support modeling and visualization of the problem
set through to visualization of the results for the decision maker without the need to learn a
programming language. Deployment of these tools to support the quick modeling and visualization
of complex problems will be highlighted as well as best practices for effective visualizations for
decision makers.
